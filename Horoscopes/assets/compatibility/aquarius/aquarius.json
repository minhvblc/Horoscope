  "compatibility": "You both pride yourselves for your innovative nature. You both like new things. What you like even more is to think about so many global issues, that you could easily form couple hundred funds/movements/charities for all those different causes at once. Not surprisingly so, when two Aquarians come together, you create a magical, radical revolution in the world. You are always full of unique ideas and some great suggestions as well. Both of you long for excitement and are ready to embrace any changes that come your way. However, this approach to life sometimes is not especially productive. When you are too flexible and happy to adapt to any situation, you can find yourselves scattered all over the place. Thus, you need to take it easy and make plans that are productive and will satisfy your partner. You should also concentrate on solving issues among yourselves as well, not just other people's problems. If you don't invest enough in your love life, you could end up in a broken relationship without even noticing it. Since this is a combination of two individuals with similar minds, \"partners in crime\", who will push themselves to the limit to get the best results, you will be successful in virtually any project together. The only problem for you both will be to stay focused on this project long enough to actually complete it. Your relationship does not focus on emotions among yourselves, since Aquarians do not concentrate on their own feelings, but rather on global issues which will help the world at large. However, this does not mean that the relationship would lack romance. Your Aquarius partner will surprise you with gifts whenever there is any tension in the relationship."
