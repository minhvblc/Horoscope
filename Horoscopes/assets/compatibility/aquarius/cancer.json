  "compatibility": "Your free spirited personality differs completely with the rigidness of Cancer. This will make you feel like you are under restrictions, since Cancer is not willing to listen to any of your pioneering ideas no matter how smart and ground breaking they seem to be. To make this relationship work, you will have to sacrifice some of your social time to be with a quiet and stay-at-home Cancer. Remember that Cancer does not like to be the center of attention like you do. An Aquarian who has set some far-reaching career goals, should think twice before committing to a relationship with Cancer. This affair can be very time consuming, which will ultimately slow down your professional progress. Cancer has a tendency to follow strict rules and guidelines. This will bring conflict in the relationship because you value your freedom and you are not good at following rules. Cancer is very romantic, and Aquarius always enjoys the attention. Your relationship may be quite difficult for both of you, since you have different perceptions about life. Both of you will have to compromise a lot in order to make this union last a long time. Although this relationship will be a constant and hard work, there is a great amount of attraction between you two. This should keep you trying to work things out."
