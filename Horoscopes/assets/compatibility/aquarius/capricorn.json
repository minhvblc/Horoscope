  "compatibility": "This relationship has some major challenges. Aquarius is generally a freedom loving sign who enjoys new experiences, while conservative Capricorn is all about following the tradition. The two of you might need to get off your high horses and try to understand each other, if you want a working relationship, let alone a blossoming one. Capricorn will not get involved in a project if he/she is not sure about the outcome, while Aquarius is more humanitarian and often works hard just to make sure that everybody around them is being treated equally. If not addressed, this glaring difference in characters may cause a rift in an otherwise harmonious relationship. Another bone of contention could be the handling of financial issues. Whereas Aquarius can be a spendthrift, Capricorn is very sensitive about financial matters. However, if there is any astrological sign that can successfully stabilize Aquarius, it is Capricorn. Regular grounding is not a bad idea for Aquarius. As mentioned above, while a relationship between the two of you is quite possible, there may be a need for compromise and understanding from both parties."
