  "compatibility": "Libra loves playing by the book, while you are a free spirited person who prefers innovative ideas. Thus when the two of you get together, you end up constantly arguing. Nevertheless, this does not hinder an attraction toward each other. There is an immediate connection between you two. You are very compatible intellectually, so every conversation you have will be mentally stimulating. A relationship between the two of you will work both ways; Libra teaches Aquarius to balance their priorities, while Aquarius shows Libra how to indulge in more activities and add some spark to their lives. Libra likes to be romantically involved, creating very tight bond with their lover, while you need some personal space and time alone. This will not be a problem as long as you learn to compromise and listen to each other's needs. Any projects carried by the two of you are bound to be successful as you are both effective and efficient in what you do. Libras are known to be quite stimulating individuals. As a result of Libra's influence, you will start to expand your horizons in different ways. Libra and Aquarius planets Venus and Uranus will spell attraction, a sense of total fulfillment, craving for adventure as well as satisfaction. Although you have some differences, as long as you share mutual respect for each other, your relationship will be growing and unfolding beautifully."
