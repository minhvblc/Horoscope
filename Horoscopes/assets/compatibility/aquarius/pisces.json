  "compatibility": "You are a caring couple. Both of you put all your efforts toward making the world a better place to live. You have different approaches for solving individual problems. Pisces is compassionate and sympathetic. Pisces gets attached to people quite easily, whereas Aquarius does not like to have strong emotional anchors. Sometimes Aquarius creates unreasonable goals and is unable to achieve them, which leads to frustration that pulls Aquiarian's emotions apart. Pisces, being strong emotionally, lends you, Aquarius, the support you need. Although for Pisces trust is an important issue, you will find it hard to trust each other at the beginning of a relationship, but the feeling of trust can eventually grow. You should try to be more receptive and open to loyalty issues. When you work together on a task as a couple, the outcome is usually extraordinary, since the combination of Pisces's imaginative mind and the innovative mind of Aquarius creates original ideas. You are both very intellectual signs who enjoy spending time discussing metaphysical topics, due to your ability to undertake comprehensive research regarding certain matters."
