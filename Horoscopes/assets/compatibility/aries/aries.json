  "compatibility": "The relationship between the two of you will be demonstrated by ego clashes since both of you are highly competitive. Occasionally, there will be lack of cooperation since both of you want to be in charge. However, when you combine your energy toward one common purpose, you make a very strong and energetic team. Aries respects and understands the need for independence and self-expression. It is very likely that Aries will give you personal space. At the beginning of a relationship, you pursue romance at a fast pace. You relish pursuing a new interest, but after capturing the target, you get bored. Both of you are likely to enter a relationship in a hurried manner, hoping to know if it will last. However, you must learn to be patient and give the relationship a chance to grow and mature. As a couple, the two of you can have an enormous impact in the world around you, that is if you do not waste your time, energy and skills to compete with each other. One positive aspect of your union is the ability to provide support for each other either at work or in social circles. For your relationship to survive, you should avoid being too independent, as doing so will cause conflicts and tension in this partnership."
