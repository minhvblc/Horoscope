  "compatibility": "Your signs are contradictory and can be compared to day and night, sunshine and rain. Despite this difference, it is true that opposites attract and you may have a chance of forming a lasting relationship. Unlike Aries who is decisive, it takes Libra some time to make up their mind. Prior to coming up with a decision, Libra has to think over and over until they are certain of receiving a positive outcome. On the other side of the coin, you are adventurous and not afraid of making decisions regardless if they turn out to be wrong. Libra is hesitant and doubtful, you on the other hand, have a very strong ego. Libra looks at issues from different viewpoints and often argues in every possible angle and this can irritate and make you angry. You are a complete opposite. You make fast decisions and tend to deal with matters quite fast. Both of you are very sociable albeit for different reasons. Libra likes to explore people's personalities and conversations on the deeper level, while you prefer to concentrate on the surface and then move on to new interests and conquests. If you spend adequate time with Libra, you will bring out fascinating characters in him/her. Keep in mind that only spending significant amount of quality time together will make the relationship tick and be fruitful."
