  "compatibility": "There is a strong initial attraction between the two of you, but as time goes by, the level of attraction will decrease. Although the first impression will be powerful, a number of differences will have to be addressed. You need to practice caution before getting into a relationship with Pisces. Pisces is characterized by water, whereas you are represented by fire. For this reason, Pisces will dampen your fun-loving character and ardent spirit. Pisces represents a secretive and hidden zone for Aries, making the relationship between them mysterious or unusual. Whereas Aries can bring about change in Pisces, you cannot alter their essential fundamental quality. To a certain extent, Pisces will find you very helpful and this is likely to affect their sensitivity. Aries is tough and can get through difficult situations without bruising their ego; whereas the sensitive Pisces finds it difficult to cope through tough times. Despite the differences, both of you will benefit from the relationship, if you make certain compromises. Pisces will be able to teach you more about compassion, empathy and spirituality if you pay close attention to their words. They will also offer you complete support without expecting anything in return. To satisfy the sensitive character of Pisces, you must not take them for granted."
