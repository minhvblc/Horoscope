  "compatibility": "This combination is very powerful, yet for it to mature, both of you must learn to adapt and adjust to different environments. Scorpio is full of emotional intensity whereas Aries is strong willed and independent. Aries is fiery and quick whereas Scorpio exudes a cool, calm and collected expression on the outside while there is emotional volatility on the inside. Aries likes to take charge, while Scorpio likes to be in control. Though in the beginning of a relationship Scorpio will let Aries have all his/her way, it will not be long until Scorpio's real intentions, which are to control the relationship, will be revealed. For the relationship to mature and be productive, both of you must work to reduce any battle of wills. Aries likes to deal with issues head on and will tell all their secrets, whereas Scorpio is secretive and will keep issues inside. This makes it hard for them to open up and share, regardless if they are hurting. Since both of you have different perspectives on issues, there will be occasions where you will not see eye to eye. You are always at odds with each other since Aries does something without having complete facts, while Scorpio will take time and think hard before making final decision."
