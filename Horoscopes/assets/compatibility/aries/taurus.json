  "compatibility": "There is a potential difficulty presented with this union. Aries will waste no time in rushing to make a decision to get quick results, Taurus on the other hand, is patient and will take time to think before arriving at a conclusion. Aries can become impatient and irritated by how slow Taurus responds. For the relationship to have a chance of survival, both of you need to compromise. You need to learn from each other to avoid any intellectual and emotional stress in the relationship. You, could benefit from learning patience from Taurus, while Taurus could learn to be more energetic and confident just like you. Aries is enthusiastic about pursuing a partner, whereas Taurus is cautious and will take time before deciding. On a more emotional level, you are much more flexible and prone to change your mind quickly, while Taurus is more dependent and possessive. Taurus needs security and for the relationship to work, they need to be assured that you will stay and not leave them hanging. If you give Taurus the commitment, loyalty and assurance to be there in the future, and if both of you compromise on trivial issues, your relationship will be productive and full of bliss."
