  "compatibility": "The critical, perfectionist and cool Virgo has very different characteristic from Aries. This difference is likely to make you irritated and even annoyed with each other. Virgo likes everything to be detailed and very precise, while Aries is not known for carrying out activities with precision. Virgo is more prone to repeating instructions just to make sure that Aries can understand. Virgo will not be satisfied with loose answers, they need to know every detail to be fully satisfied. Virgo is service oriented and can be counted on to take care of the home and ensure everything from bills, receipts and other important papers are kept well in order. The combination between Virgo and Aries is highly suited for work and financial matters. Both of you can learn great lessons from each other. If Aries is willing and open to apply the advice Virgo gives on financial matters, both of you are likely to benefit from it. On the other hand, if Virgo is attentive and willing to experiment, both of you can learn to be more energetic, adventurous and take risks. This combination will be very productive and successful if you decide to work together, because Virgo will offer complete support in areas that are not usually your strong side. This is attributed by the fact that Virgo is more focused on perfection and service. For the union to succeed, we suggest you to spend time exploring and learning each other's subtleties prior to committing to a serious relationship."
