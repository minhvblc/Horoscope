  "compatibility": "You are bound to be emotionally drained by Capricorns, because they consider sensitivity to be some sort of weakness. Capricorns are rigid, and sometimes can be described as cold-blooded. Cancer could take it upon themselves to make Capricorn soften up somewhat. The two of you are distinct opposites and for you to see eye-to-eye on any issue, there has to be a change in your expressive behavior. Another distinct difference between the two of you is the divergent views on materialism. Capricorn is easily attracted to material things and puts much emphasis on them, while you do not regard them that much. Capricorns are not all that cold as they can be very supportive and nurturing in a relationship. You need to evaluate each other thoroughly if a long-term bond is expected. Compromise is needed from both parties. A strong bond is expected between Cancers and Capricorns who are born between December 22 and January 1. In an intimate relationship, Cancers usually relate to older Capricorns, who offer sufficient nurturing. This is a pairing of extremes and it could either work out well or be disastrous for both parties."
