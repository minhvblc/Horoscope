They can always lift up your spirit. At the same time, your loving nature is very likely to appeal to Leo. For the relationship to work out, Leo needs to reduce the energy level a little bit. Being dramatic could scare Cancer who is at times timid. The bond between you may not be evident when the two of you meet but like wine, it matures over time. Leo is likely to be the dominant party in this relationship because they like to take the lead. Attention is usually directed to them and that is how they like it. You are comfortable taking a back seat and leaving the spotlight on Leo. Flattery is a good way of stroking the egoistic Leo and they need it on a regular basis. You on the other hand, are more content with your own disposition. Leo is very generous materialistically thus, is likely to buy you plenty of presents. If Leo can show a certain amount of restraint, this relationship could flourish into a passionate pairing. Both of you are well receptive to romantic advances."
