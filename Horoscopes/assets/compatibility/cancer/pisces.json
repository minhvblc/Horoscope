  "compatibility": "These two signs are related to water, and thus the two of you are well suited to each other. Your personalities are similar. You both share some qualities, such as sensitivity and emotionality. Pisces is more intuitive than Cancer, but their underlying compassion is what creates a bond. If the two of you are to go into business, it will work out best as a service oriented or freelance enterprise. In this kind of establishment, you will be able to meet personally with clients and show your empathy. Pisces happens to be a dreamer and thus needs someone who can share their fantasies. Cancer is always ready to nurture and offer much needed reassurance. Pisces could also be unable to withstand pressure and could engage in various forms of escapism. Cancer will do the same, only if faced with rejection from other people. The two of you share the passion for photography and film, as well as poetry. There is some kind of psychic connection and at times, it may seem like you can read each other's minds. This understanding may, however, lead to one party taking advantage of the other. This relationship will allow both of you to go through life lessons with effortless mutual understanding."
