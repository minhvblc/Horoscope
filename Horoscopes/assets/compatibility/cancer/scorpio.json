  "compatibility": "Cancer and Scorpio have an intrinsic quality that brings them together. Both of you are caring, emotional and sensitive. However, Scorpio has other ways of showing their love. Scorpio normally demands more attention than they give in return. The sensitivity that you show to your Scorpio may not be enough; your partner can get somewhat possessive. As long as Scorpio is able to control their urge to dominate the relationship, things will take a good turn. There is some discrepancy in the romance aspect. Scorpio is more driven by sensual desires, while Cancer needs for a relationship to be more than just physical. Scorpio also has a measure of emotional intensity which remains hidden deep inside. You should be aware of Scorpio's secretive nature, and therefore restrain from meddling in his/her affairs. In order to gain approval of Scorpio, you should ensure that money matters are handled with much care. You need someone who is protective, and Scorpio fits this description perfectly. You, on the other hand, are content with offering your affection to the other party. You are the one to provide a calming effect, when times get a little rough. This relationship could easily lead to a strong marriage bond."
