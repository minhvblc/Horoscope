  "compatibility": "Aries is more of a spontaneous individual, who is enthusiastic and always ready to engage in anything, while Capricorn is more of a methodical being who plans ahead before doing something. This is however, not a major difference that could lead to complications when in a relationship. These two signs also do not have a similar self-expression character mode. They respond to issues in a different manner, which might result in major misunderstandings between the two. Aries may perhaps attempt to make spontaneous decisions, and Capricorn might end up seeing these decisions as foolish and unsound. You may appear to be inconsiderate to Aries, since it is hard for you to get in touch with your emotional side. Also, you do not get easily excited like Aries does; this can leave Aries feeling aggravated, waiting for Capricorn to show some sentiment. Capricorn, you can be somewhat up tight; however, you are truthful, dependable and loyal in your relationships. Consequently, the relationship may perhaps be deficient in impulsive light-hearted flirting or fun. There is a similarity between the two of you, when it comes to leadership, since you are both charismatic leaders who exhibit strength in character. This stems from the fact that Aries has a strong impulsive desire to succeed, while Capricorn possesses great power of endurance and strives for domination and recognition."
