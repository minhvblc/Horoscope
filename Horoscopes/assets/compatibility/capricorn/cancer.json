  "compatibility": "Capricorn and Cancer are two very different signs, but they end up blending with each other. Cancer is known to suffer emotional stress or drain from Capricorn. This is attributed to the fact that Capricorn ends up teaching Cancer to be tough, not to cry and how not to personalize issues, so that they do not get hurt easily. In other words, Cancer is stabilized by Capricorn. Capricorn is associated with corporate, rigid, cold or aloof approaches to sentimental issues. Cancer on the other hand, trains Capricorn how to be soft and willing to express or show emotions and feelings. Cancer should just accept that they will never connect with Capricorn on the emotional level. However, Cancer will be surprised by the display of affection by Capricorn after there is a mutual understanding. It may, perhaps, take some time, but it will be worth it in the end. In order for the two of you to co-exist in a healthy manner, you should both be willing to compromise on various issues that make you different. Cancer must use logic when dealing with the demeanor of Capricorn. In turn, you, Capricorn, should show that you can be considerate and supportive. You should also learn how to appeal to the sensitive side of Cancer in order for the relationship to thrive."
