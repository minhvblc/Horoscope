  "compatibility": "The two of you have very different personalities. Gemini may find Capricorn to be steady, quiet and somewhat boring, while Capricorn may perhaps view Gemini as unstable and unreliable. Capricorn is dependable, serious and slow, while Gemini is spontaneous, breezy and light in nature. Gemini is used to frequent changes and variety, while Capricorn likes to follow a methodical or planned order. These differences may end up being a turn-off to both if caution is not taken. Capricorn is serious and takes a non-humorous approach to life, while Gemini is very playful since they like a constant change of mind. In order for the two of you to be compatible, you have to concentrate on your strong traits and put them together. Gemini can come up with some wild ideas, since they are very clever, while you can turn these ideas into practice. Capricorn requires stability and everything you engage in should serve a particular purpose. Capricorn will engage mostly in activities that promise financial success. On the other hand, Gemini enjoys fun outings and in the absence of good times, everything will seem to be like chores to them. Capricorn is more reserved when around people, while Gemini is more outgoing."
