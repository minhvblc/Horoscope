  "compatibility": "Leo is a more outgoing sign, who is always concerned about their status, security and other accomplishments. Capricorn is more of a reserved individual, but you have the same drive to succeed, only in more of a systematic method. Leo is a dramatic individual with interest in affectionate gestures, spontaneity and dramatic displays of feelings. This can be difficult for Capricorn, but the attraction between the two will still be appealing as the relationship progresses. Capricorn does not get excited like Leo does, and this may make you uncomfortable in articulating sentimental responses. Lack of response exhibited by you will puzzle or frustrate Leo. A relationship between the two of you will ultimately be successful as you both focus on the relationship by devoting energy to care and comfort each other. Leo is the only individual that might be able to lift the spirits of Capricorn. Both of you are ambitious, although, you achieve your ambitions in quite different ways. Leo exhibits regal superiority, while Capricorn remains reserved. You will also be loyal to each other for the duration of the relationship. It takes some time for Capricorn to open up to their partner while it takes a short time for Leo to trust their loved one."
