  "compatibility": "At times, Capricorn may display signs of being pessimistic or too serious about life. Sagittarius is a complete opposite since they have an expanded optimism that they can use in swaying Capricorn to see life from a different and more positive angle. Capricorn can at times dampen the enthusiasm of Sagittarius, while Sagittarius can stifle Capricorn with their silly upbeat humor. Capricorn is a little conservative, but they provide a good stabilizing force. Sagittarius complements it by adding some spark into the systematic approach, that Capricorn sticks to through introducing Capricorn to different people, traveling and encouraging a spirit of adventure. When it comes to relationships, time is needed by both Sagittarius and Capricorn to get to know each other before making any commitments. Both of you should use this time to learn about your partner, so that you understand better where your differences come from. You have a tendency to suppress your true feelings, which may end up appearing restrained. You are attracted to individuals with high self esteem, and you are very loyal when it comes to relationships."
