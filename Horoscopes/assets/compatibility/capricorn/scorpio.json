  "compatibility": "You both have longings and cravings, but you have different ways of expressing them. Capricorn is driven by the desire to accomplish and achieve, while Scorpio wants to control and gain power. Capricorn has approaches that are factual, while Scorpio uses more complex ways to get what they need. Both Capricorn and Scorpio have a great ability to be engulfed with an immense intensity, no matter what they engage in. You, Capricorn, are more methodical rather than sentimental, which is the opposite of Scorpio. You may seem to be ignoring Scorpio, when you take some time to think things through, as you tend to drift away, in order to focus. Similarly, Scorpio drifts away when thinking, but they express more intensity or relentless effort until they regain control of the problem. This can be best described by the word \"determination\", which is a quality that you both display. Scorpio is generally a stubborn individual who will not be easily swayed into changing their mind after a decision has been made. Capricorn always takes a serious methodical approach to solve issues. Despite the differences, both of you can get satisfied with each other through engaging in activities that are common to both."
