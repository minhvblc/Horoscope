  "compatibility": "Both Gemini and Aquarius are air signs and their combination results in wind. On most levels, both of you are strong and capable of bringing fulfillment in the relationship. This usually comes in handy, especially at some important times in Gemini's life. There is a high possibility of meeting the ideal Aquarian when least expected. Once you meet, it will be obvious, that some significance exists in this connection. Aquarius is naturally rebellious, sometimes for no reason. This attitude of freedom loving is a turn-on for Gemini, because it is a reminder of what you desire in life, including intellectual fulfillment, variety and excitement. Aquarius is ruled by the planet Uranus, which provides the partnership with an abundance of energy, which stimulates Gemini. Gemini respects Aquarius who is capable of offering inspiration in numerous ways, other than just romantically. Additionally, Aquarians have the potential of triggering the humanitarian and more refined side of Gemini. Intimately, your strength of connection rests on you both being communicators. You will spend endless hours sharing your deepest secrets, imaginations and thoughts. In order to learn from one another, Gemini should offer Aquarius more focus and understanding."
