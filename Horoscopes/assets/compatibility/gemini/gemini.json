  "compatibility": "The natural communication affinity shared between you two, allows you to connect rather easily and develop the ability of fully satisfying each other's needs. You will spend endless hours talking, exchanging ideas and generally taking pleasure, being together either during social events or just being in the intimate presence of each other. Like no other sign, your Gemini partner has the potential and ability to understand the ideas you come up with, and often bounces back with perceptions that stimulate idealism and creativity. The weak point of this relationship is related to your inconsistency and inability to be grounded. Gemini needs their partner to play the role of anchoring them. Both of you however have an inclination of skimming on the surface of any topic and thus can not be the anchor of each other. There is a mutual preference of being the buzzing bee all over the flower garden, instead of the bee that opts to settle down and build the hive. If you are seeking a continuous relationship, certain issues will have to be dealt with, including monetary and stability ones. Though these are not your topics of choice, they will nevertheless require to be given much deeper consideration, if you want this relationship to work out. It is similarly very important though, to reflect on what affects your emotions, because you are both \"air heads\" with restless minds."
