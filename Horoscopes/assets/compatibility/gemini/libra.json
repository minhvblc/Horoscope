  "compatibility": "This is quite an amazing combination and is likely to be an outstanding match at the onset, as well as in the long run. The planets Mercury and Venus that rule Gemini and Libra correspondingly, are personal planetary friends. Gemini and Libra have a great potential of transforming their companionship into something unique. Libra is bound to love the intellectual input of Gemini, and may actually view you with high esteem, especially in regard to educational issues. You will share a very complete social life, and collect many unforgettable moments spent with friends in surroundings, that usually are rather artistic. The best trait in a Gemini and Libra combination is your ability of working together intellectually. It is highly probable that both of you take pleasure in theatre, while being active in arts. Gemini likes racing around doing multiple jobs, and this briskness and restlessness is something that Libra highly enjoys. Neither Gemini nor Libra feels content with idleness, but you will still enjoy sitting by the fireplace, reading a book, while sipping your favorite drink. Both of you are exceptionally well suited, romantically, intimately and intellectually. You can seek love, warmth and comfort from this relationship. It is a lucky combination with a magic touch between the two of you."
