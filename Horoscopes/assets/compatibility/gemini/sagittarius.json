  "compatibility": "This is an intriguing combination of energies that forms from opposite zodiac signs. Such a combination is usually considered great, but it very depends on the perspective that is taken. Fluctuation is a part of the nature of these two signs, and this implies that they can both expect significant variety and change in their lives. This is what they are destined for, and the progressive movement is essential to their emotional and mental health. So since both of you are very much alike in that sense, it makes it so much easier for you to understand the restless nature of the other. Socially, Gemini is more of an intellectual person while Sagittarius has a preference for an idealistic and philosophical general analysis of the world and life in itself. Both Gemini and Sagittarius love traveling. Traveling together can provide an ideal converging point for Gemini's desire to interact socially. It can also fulfill Sagittarius's cravings for philosophical and cultural matters. Although in different circumstances these can seemingly appear diametrically opposed. Opposite star signs, when in relationship, usually get highly engaged in romantic and marriage commitments. It should not be a surprise that once the paths of Gemini and Sagittarius cross, a thrilling interplay will be experienced by both. However, because these two are volatile signs, making firm decisions regarding your future together may prove to be rather complicated. The mixture of similarities and differences in the personalities of Gemini and Sagittarius only means though that additional effort is needed, in order to make their relationship work."
