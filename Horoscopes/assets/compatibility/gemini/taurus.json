  "compatibility": "While Taurus has a tendency of methodically and deeply digging to the core of things. This sign takes  similar approach to problem solving. Gemini leaps between ideas with considerable naivety and curiosity. This does not necessarily mean that Gemini's humor and wit fails to infatuate Taurus. It is only that they require a steadier and slower pace. However, this combination can be considered as being unsuccessful on certain levels, mainly because the restlessness of Gemini may be too excessive for slower and much more methodical Taurus. Both Gemini and Taurus will have an abundance of things to discuss and are contented to spend countless hours together, given that the surrounding environment is stimulating. The two of you are pleasure-seekers and have a tendency of satisfying both your physical and intellectual appetites. Intimately, Gemini tends to be rather fast-paced in comparison to the usually much slower Taurus, hence the need for a considerable amount of sensual and touch stimulation. Since Taurus may fail to respond as cheerfully as Gemini would like, this raises the need of the latter talking more and Taurus touching more. An evolved Taurus may, for instance put their intellectual capabilities into a high gear and consequently arouse Gemini via a verbal approach. Gemini should thus work against being impatient by overlooking the finer courtship details, because Taurus may otherwise be left dry and high."
