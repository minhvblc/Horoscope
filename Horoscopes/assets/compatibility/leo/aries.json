  "compatibility": "Both of you share creativity and desire for independence, and both of you are very vivacious signs. Aries rarely interferes with the life of Leo, and that is what makes this couple very compatible with each other. You can stand one another, when living in the same environment. You will not have any problems respecting Aries's need for space and freedom, and that is something Aries highly values. One of the drawbacks in this union is the fact that Aries likes to dominate in everything they and Leo do together. It involves every aspect of life such as work, love and partnership, since Aries is a natural born leader. Nonetheless, you still are very compatible. You both are most likely to be very happy with each other, since both of you are full of passion. Leo is more accommodative and very willing to comprise in a relationship or friendship. Caring about personal image is what separates these two signs. Leo is conscious about what other people think, while Aries does not give much thought and rarely cares about public image. An aggressive Aries normally does not believe in second chances, and this is something you should bear in mind, while dealing with Aries. You both love adventure and traveling, and will enjoy each other's company when going on a long trip, which will be full of unexpected wonders. In business, both of you have swirling temperaments that can glue together perfectly to produce excellent work."
