  "compatibility": "Leo usually looks for casual and open relationships, whereas Cancer prefers serious, stable and long-term partnership. Such differences are easy to sort out with Cancer assuring and bestowing Leo with plenty of love and admiration. The relationship between the two of you will be strong and can survive for a long time, if Cancer persists with showing true love. Sometimes Cancer lacks self-confidence, Cancer is too fragile and has a low self-esteem. This can make it difficult for Leo to adjust to, since it calls for too much energy investment. However, most of the time it is a manageable drawback. There is a possibility, that Cancer will gain momentum, and be on the same high confidence level. Cancer's planet Moon can supply enough light through Leo's planet Sun, which will keep Leo maintaining the relationship until Cancer will gain momentum. The insecure Cancer needs a strong, honest, kind and caring Leo. This forms a sense of reliance to the dependable Cancer, and this combination will be usually more successful for male Leo and female Cancer. Although, often times, Cancerians will not appear insecure, especially while conflicting with other people, that is only the hard shell that they like to keep on. On the inside, however, they are total softies and very emotionally vulnerable. Leo can also compensate Cancer's need to see love affection as both physical and emotional support. At the same time, Cancers like a much more settled and calm relationship whereas you, Leo, love to go out and hang out with friends even when you are involved in a serious relationship. This can be major obstacle to Cancer, who needs you to show and prove your love endlessly."
