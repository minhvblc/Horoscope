  "compatibility": "Both Leo and Scorpio are romantic, and when the two of you bond, it usually lasts forever. You are a fire sign and Scorpio loves to play with fire. On the other hand, fire signs usually fall for water signs. Both of you will demand respect and form a very powerful couple with spectacular leadership skills, unless one of you tries to control the other. In which case the relationship is not likely to last. You may not be attracted to each other at first, and it may require a few tries before you can accept each other's advances. A little persuasion from Leo is necessary to tranquil the iciness of Scorpio. As time passes by, Scorpio usually submits to the sunny rays of Leo. Scorpio has a confident and proud character, that ideally supports the nature Leo has; that of being energetic, powerful and determined to achieve anything that they set their mind on. Once the relationship is solid enough, both of you will stick to each other through thick and thin. At times, Scorpio has a weird fascination about life after death, which may scare Leo. Leo's respect for the views of Scorpio comes in handy when Leo wants to display intellectual abilities in any topic of conversation. Both of you agree on discussing personal issues in private away from the public eye, although Scorpio is more secretive than Leo. Sometimes you will find it hard to understand Scorpio's secrets. Due to your hard positions and resistance to change, you have to find a way of dealing with new situations if you want your relationship to mature."
