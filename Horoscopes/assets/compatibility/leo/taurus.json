  "compatibility": "This combination is a bit challenging, since Leo's ruling planet is the Sun, while Taurus is ruled by Venus. These are both fixed signs. Thus the two of you are not very comfortable together, anywhere except for the bedroom. The attraction is very intense, connection is instant and both of you are very willing to explore each other on the first date. Leo has a protective personality, which is typical of lions, and this attracts Taurus. Taurus knows that if they are in a relationship, their Leo partner will protect them at any cost. Leo will support Taurus and make them more confident, although they find it hard to bring out romantic and intimate feelings from Taurus. You will be most happy in passionate arms of each other. Both of you are adventurous, sensuous and craving for more in the bedroom. However, the moment you leave the boudoir and go into the real world, everything becomes so much harder. Being both fixed signs, you just refuse to see each other's point of view. Leo is short-tempered and Taurus is too stubborn. Leo feels like they should be leaders in a romantic relationship, whereas Taurus provides the attention that Leo requires, but they will expect something in return. You like shiny and expensive things, but Taurus will not approve of your splurge, unless you can provide a very good and sufficient excuse. A long lasting romantic relationship is nearly impossible without great sacrifice from both of you. However, you can become excellent business partners. Both of you are fully focused on job objectives that come first, before your personal needs."
