  "compatibility": "Leo has a forceful nature that can easily overshadow humble and timid Virgo. However, You should not use your powerful status to take advantage of modest Virgo. Although Virgo tends to work in silence behind closed doors and rarely demands attention, they are very careful and accurate in their work. Leo often exploits this weakness to dominate in this relationship, becoming an absolute leader. Thus it is usually important, which sign is male and which is female. If you are a male Leo, the relationship will likely to work better since it will be much more natural for the subservient and submissive Virgo to follow your lead. Virgo usually does not mind taking the back seat. Even though you are so confident and powerful, Virgo can often times push you to the wall with their tendency to pay attention to minor details. Although, Virgo's personality very much depends on the day of birth. If Virgo is born between  August 24 and September 2, they are likely to be less strung, which means that they will make good friends. In addition, a Virgo born between September 3 and September 12 tends to be slightly more serious, but since they connect with the planet Saturn they are known to be warm, open but less spontaneous. There is a chance of a happy relationship between the two of you. Leo attracts Virgo with their good sense of humor, open heart, loving nature and their strong character. Virgo, on the other side, will compliment you with all the small things. Those things that you usually discard as not important, going through life at a speed of light, but which, in fact, most often are."
