  "compatibility": "Although initial attraction is most likely to be very strong and passionate, the two of you exhibit two different character traits. Libra loves kisses, closeness, romance, attending social functions and considers their partner to be the most important person in their life. Libra also likes to be with someone at all times and might feel lost when alone. On the other hand, Aries is more independent, stronger and confident and likes to be in control. Libra relies on Aries in finding major solutions, since Aries is quick and decisive. Aries may at times get annoyed by the indecisive nature of Libra, which might lead to quarrels between the two. Libra has a high affinity to getting drawn to Aries. Most of the relationships between the two are either marital or business related. This is inevitable since the majority of people are drawn to their exact opposites. However, relationships between the two may perhaps not last, since Libra will get tired of following Aries. Libra is not quick to end the current relationship, until they are sure that there is another one that is awaiting them. Libra perseveres until they find another partner then leaves. A union between the two of you will make Libra dependent if they learn how to compromise. This forms the basis of a connection with Aries."
