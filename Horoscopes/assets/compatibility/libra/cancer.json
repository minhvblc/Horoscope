  "compatibility": "Astrologically, these two signs make a right angle, and this means that it could be a challenging combination within the Zodiac. This combination is bound to produce a great deal of uneasiness. The differences between you two may not be very apparent during your first encounter. The two of you need to find harmony, which is hard to do, since you have too many distractions. Cancer prefers a laid back lifestyle which could lead to confrontation with you and your preference for social interaction. For this reason, you may consider Cancer as one who lacks enthusiasm, or is simply outdated. You relate well when you are working on projects and Cancer has a good way of nurturing good ideas and helping them to blossom into big accomplishments. You, Libra, on the other hand, would do well as the person to publicize the project. When it comes to intimate relationships, there is a sense of fulfillment whenever you come together. This couple has many positive aspects to it, you just need to work on some negative things. Cancer people born around the end of June tend to be extremely sensitive. They are able to offer love, as well as emotional support to their partners. However there is a downside to all this sensitivity of Cancer, especially if you are a male Libra. You just don't know when and why you got your Cancer partner upset, and it will most definitely take them hours to get over it. Moreover you can be absolutely sure that although it is forgiven, it will never be forgotten. The relationship works better if the sexes are reversed since Libra male wants peace and stability."
