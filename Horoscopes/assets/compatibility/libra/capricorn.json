  "compatibility": "This combination may seem like a very unlikely one, but you will be surprised at what each of you can bring into the relationship. The success of the romance will depend upon how much either of you will be willing to adjust. Capricorn is not only controlling, but they also have (sometimes compulsive) desire to accumulate material wealth in order to create some sort of security and power around themselves. This is going to be the major bone-of-contention in your relationship, because Capricorn does not believe in sharing power. Capricorn will use their wealth and charisma to gain the upper hand, and sometimes this can extend to the relationship. This will not go well with you, because you prefer to let people have their own way. Your ruling planets, Venus and Saturn might be astrologically friendly but carrying this into the relationship will prove to be a daunting task. Libra will enjoy the relatively comfortable life with Capricorn, but you should not use this as the basis for success in your partnership. Libra is highly social, bubbly and spontaneous, which is the complete opposite of their Capricorn mate, who prefers being alone or with a few friends in a laid back setting. When it comes to bedroom matters, Libra is adventurous while Capricorn is more conservative. This can be a problem if one partner is not willing to meet the other at least half way in the union."
