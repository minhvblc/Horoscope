  "compatibility": "This is a perfect match, although you may happen to experience some difficulty making decisions. Despite having a strong mental and emotional connection, you find it hard to come to a common agreement on certain issues. You will need to make a concrete solution, despite the fact that you have differing opinions. You will also find it somewhat difficult to deal with the practicalities of life, since both of you tend to lose your head in the clouds. You should try and tackle only the things that you can manage as a pair. Libra is quite demanding and the two of you will have some stringent standards set out for each other. But unlike with other signs, you will find it easier to understand and accept this, since you know first hand where it comes from. There is a need for peace and harmony in this pairing, but unfortunately this is not always the case. You will find that sometimes you get too engrossed in aspects of life, that you forget about your emotional obligations. You should not allow quarrels and grudges to stand between what is likely to be a good relationship. Notwithstanding the ups and downs that might be there, the two of you are usually cheerful no matter what the situation may be."
