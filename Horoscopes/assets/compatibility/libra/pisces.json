  "compatibility": "Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac, and this usually means that Pisces is more likely to explore the spiritual nature of humans. Pisces is also selfless and will not care much about material wealth. Pisces is an introvert who draws their motivation from within and is therefore, deeply intuitive and receptive. A relationship with Pisces might not last because after a while, Libra will find out that their partner seem detached and lives in a world of their own. Libra is naturally social and bubbly and being with Pisces will greatly hinder your chances of exploring this side of you, because Pisces would prefer to be by themselves in a quiet place. Pisces is intelligent and would probably match you well intellectually, but they would prefer to keep this to themselves rather than find common topics to talk about. Pisces may not realize that a healthy discussion could potentially strengthen the relationship. They would prefer to listen rather than talk but when they talk, Libra might not be able to comprehend what they are saying, which can create conflicts in the relationship. Due to deeply spiritual nature of Pisces, you might not always be able to relate to what they are going through and will be feeling left out of their lives."
