  "compatibility": "The relationship between Libra and Sagittarius is a comfortable one, because communication comes easy. You make a great partner for the wild, outspoken and rough Sagittarius. Your refined nature will tend to rub off on Sagittarius as well. Libra shares with Sagittarius a number of common qualities, such as tolerance for change, variety and adventure. This means that your relationship is not only going to be exciting, but also full of adventure and new experiences. You should also be very comfortable in the quiet company of each other, or among other people. It does not really matter what you do, as long as you stay together. The two of you would make very good friends as well, because you share many interests, such as traveling and discovering new things. Sagittarius is usually very open about their sexuality, therefore you might need to communicate to your partner that you would rather take it slow and develop an emotional attachment first. The perfect Sagittarius match for you is one born between November 23rd and December 1st, although sometimes they might be too pompous to suit your tastes. If you focus on only what is important, you will have a wonderful relationship with Sagittarius."
