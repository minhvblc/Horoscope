  "compatibility": "A relation between the two of you will be full of emotions. Both Cancer and Pisces are very sensitive and sentimental signs. They are individuals who take things seriously and personally. This is because they have a strong ability to empathize with others. Pisces's intuition and the sensitive nature of Cancer makes the two have an understanding and compassion for others. At times, Pisces cries and Cancer shies away. Pisces is gullible and can get hurt easily, when it comes to matters of the heart. This can be avoided if the two of you follow your instincts rather than reasoning, since you tend to attach emotion to decision making. Cancer strives to find peaceful home and family, and this is where Pisces can cater them perfectly, by providing precisely what they need. You will be happy while engaging in various activities such as swimming and dancing, as well as some creative art pursuits. You are a dreamer and always fantasize about relationships, and this is equally met by Cancer, who provides an understanding and a nurturing reassurance. These signs are extremely impressionistic and require grounding from time to time. Both Pisces and Cancer have a skill for photography and film. You can also spice up your life by trying out new things together. Spontaneity will not cause any frictions. At times, you both will find yourselves able to read each others minds."
