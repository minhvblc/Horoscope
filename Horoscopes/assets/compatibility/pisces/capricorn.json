  "compatibility": "Despite the differences that these two signs exhibit, the two of you complement each other and provide what the other needs. If you succeed in taking the good traits of your partner and learn to build on them, you will be able to create a long lasting relationship, which will bring much happiness to each of you. Both of you are eager to explore weird places just for the thrill of it, and are prone to associate with others who have similar interests. You tend to be extremely comfortable in each other's company. You also challenge each other in a good way, which helps you to improve yourselves. When it comes to romantic relationship, Pisces and Capricorn need a safe and secure environment, since Pisces loves attention and Capricorn has affectionate feelings and a sense of loyalty for their partners. This makes the two of you compatible in every manner. It should be very easy for the two of you to develop a healthy relation, which will be full of love. Things will only seem to be getting better as time goes by. When it comes to intimacy, both of you have a way of surprising each other. On the flip side, Capricorn is known to play strange mind games with their partner and this rubs Pisces the wrong way. However, this does not prompt Pisces into any reactionary behavior, as they are able to compromise for the greatest good of the relationship."
