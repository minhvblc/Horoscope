  "compatibility": "Gemini is intellectual, clever and witty, while Pisces is sensitive, intuitive and compassionate. This divergence in character might cause some problems. Pisces might be willing to compromise on many issues, but in order for this relationship to work out, Gemini has to be aware of the emotional side of their partner. If Gemini is not capable of understanding, this is going to be the point, at which communication breaks. Afterwards Gemini will find it difficult to appeal to Pisces's soft side. Pisces can at times live in a fantasy world with idealistic romantic exploits, that can be detrimental to their relationship. Gemini is not swayed by emotions, they are more realistic when it comes to romance. Pisces takes things seriously and thus Gemini should be cautious when they feel like flirting. The wandering nature of Gemini, although completely innocent, will make Pisces jealous and uneasy very soon. Both Gemini and Pisces are prone to digress from plans already made, but they cope well with the spontaneity of such alterations. Pisces looks for the greater good in a person, despite the first impressions created. Pisces lives in a fantasy world and would rather tolerate the suffering, than hurt Gemini's feelings. Pisces can be hard to understand, and this can cause problems with Gemini. When it comes to solving issues, Gemini can view Pisces as disoriented. If Gemini can learn to keep the promises made, show sentimental sensitivity and set some time aside to share with Pisces, then things can be extremely good between them."
