  "compatibility": "Pisces is a perceptive, extremely intuitive soul with a lot of compassion. It is easy for Pisces to understand Leo's moods and sentiments, but Pisces may find it hard to comprehend their emotions. Alternatively, Leo is much more self-confident and likes conveying their feelings in a dramatic way. It is unusual that Pisces and Leo not be drawn to one another; however, they might end up discovering that they are incompatible after uniting. Both are creative signs, and the relationship can be very dynamic and exciting. Leo has a firm character and this might attract Pisces, but there is nothing else that strongly draws them to each other in a long term relationship. Leo is a self centered and opportunistic individual. This is a complete contrast to Pisces, who readily sacrifices for the benefit of others, very often to the detriment of themselves. The opportunistic character of Leo may cause friction between the two, since Pisces will feel ignored and rejected. Remember that Pisces is a romantic being, while Leo is more of a passionate sign. Enthusiastic displays of affection might make Pisces retreat in shyness and often result in dreaming and fantasizing. Leo loves to defend and this makes them compatible with Pisces, who is usually feeling much more comfortable when there is someone to protect them. Leo likes to give a shoulder to lean on and is more of an authoritative being. This also makes it easier for Pisces to cope with Leo, since Pisces often likes someone to be there for them. Pisces in general is more submissive than other signs."
