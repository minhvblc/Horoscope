  "compatibility": "Both Pisces and Libra are very sensitive, but their sensitivity is not quite the same. Libra is mostly a dependent sign, and most of the time requires companionship. Pisces gets lost in their own world, which often makes them feel lonely. Pisces needs their partners to comfort them, understand them and offer reassurance. Fortunately, most of the time, Libra can provide this type of attention. The two of you love quiet and calm places with a scenic view. You both have a naturally strong artistic ability, which ranges from interior decorating to arts and crafts. Both of you love soft music and dancing as well. The visible differences are that Pisces is quiet, while Libra is more talkative. Pisces is a sensitive introvert, who will get frustrated with the publicity, that always surrounds Libra. Libra may be very doubtful, which makes them unsure of many things, so you will need to be the decision maker. You will also have to learn to tolerate their indecisiveness. Pisces is forgetful and this will help you deal with Libra's inability to decide. Libra has a very selfless personality, they are good diplomats that are capable of showing Pisces true compassion. Pisces, you will highly value this trait, because of your tender nature you need compassion more than other signs. Secrets and hidden issues form the basic part of your life experiences and this often results in confusion with indecisive Libra. You should learn to open up, so that Libra can be more understanding and supportive."
