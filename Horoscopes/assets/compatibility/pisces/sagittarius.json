  "compatibility": "Sagittarius is frank and energetic. Pisces appears to be calm, sensitive and gentle. The combination of this pair leads to a questionable compatibility. There are very visible differences between these signs. Sagittarius is more adventurous and straightforward, while Pisces is mystical and more delicate. However, the two of you can improve your relationship by learning to blend your differences and use them to make the combination stronger, by using all your various traits. Sagittarius is humorous and will offer comfort to Pisces in times when Pisces will be feeling down. The outgoing nature and openness of Sagittarius will assist in easing confusion that Pisces are prone to. Sagittarius will also bring Pisces from their fantasy world back into reality. In relationships, Pisces has a tendency to be clingy and overly dependent on their partner for compassion and reassurance. There might be some friction, since Sagittarius is not sentimental and may not be able to empathize with Pisces. Sagittarius dislikes restrictions of any form. They also like to look for partners who enjoy sports and outdoor activities, which does not work best with interests of Pisces. Although some Pisces actually like to dwell on their fantasies, while enjoying beautiful outdoor views. Sagittarius is naturally a good teacher, writer and instructor, and combining these talents with a pass-time activity that Pisces enjoys, will lead to a memorable moments. This blending smooths issues between these two quite different signs, making it somewhat easier for them to form a healthy relationship."
