  "compatibility": "Taurus is down to earth and requires adorable things. Pisces on the other hand, is an emotional being and needs an easygoing and soft energy. In relationships, there can be very romantic connections between the two. This can be further amplified by romantic gestures e.g. soft music and incense during a romantic outing. All these things have a sentimental value to both Pisces and Taurus. Pisces and Taurus are both patient, but Pisces has a highly sophisticated sense of intuition. You should follow your instincts when making decisions since you tend to be emotional when you reason things out. In this sense Taurus is just the opposite. This sign likes to reason without applying much emotional attachment. Taurus might find trouble coping with Pisces due to this somewhat emotional disconnect. Pisces may seem to be lacking ambition and strength to go on, when things become tough, and here you can rely on a much more reasonable and practical Taurus. In relationships, Pisces generally gives their all, and will commit eternally after you win their heart and prove to be trustworthy. Taurus will like that, since they are also a possessive and jealous sign. From time to time, you might require some privacy and some room to be alone to recharge your spirit. This does not affect Taurus partner a lot though, since they can also be the same way. They will understand your needs. This is a great combination, which is definitely worth trying."
