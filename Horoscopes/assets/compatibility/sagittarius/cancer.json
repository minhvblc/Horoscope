  "compatibility": "Cancer is so sensitive and romantic but you see, Sagittarius is as hard as a nut that cannot be cracked. Despite the fact that you like each other's company and both of you can work together extremely well, some differences will set you great distance apart. A romantic relationship between the two of you is not destined to work unless both of you learn to adjust and deal with each other's weaknesses. It is something that can require substantial work. Sagittarius sometimes is too honest to the point of being blunt and insensitive. Cancer may appreciate your honesty and joyful nature, but you have to remember that they are very sensitive to your ruthless and somewhat bold and blatant manner. Most of the time, Cancer will try to hide their true feelings from you. Diplomacy is not one of the best skills of Sagittarius but you have to learn this art if you really want to have a successful relationship with Cancer. Cancer on the other hand needs to learn to handle some of your outbursts. In addition, things can get very difficult with Cancer because they may find it hard to handle the extravagant and direct nature of Sagittarius. However, the future looks promising for this union if you deal with your differences positively."
