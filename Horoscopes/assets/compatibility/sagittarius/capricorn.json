  "compatibility": "The outgoing and temperamental Sagittarian is different from the more introvertive Capricorn. You tend to be optimistic, open and quite straightforward. You believe that life always brings you the best, even when everything is working against you. Capricorn is described as constrictive, pessimistic and cold, but this is not the case for Sagittarians as you are conservative and optimistic. Therefore, you will have to give Capricorn some time to be able to feel more relaxed and free with you. This way, Capricorn will be able to display their other side. But you have to remember that at first they will feel overpowered by you. The two of you are adventurous and love freedom. You enjoy any type of outdoor activities. This is an area where Capricorn can be less enthusiastic than you. Furthermore, if the two of you become romantically involved, you will need to try to accommodate the practical and ambitious side of Capricorn. Fortunately, Sagittarians are patient and you can handle the reserved nature of Capricorn and show them that life has plenty to offer. Luckily, Capricorns are very receptive, in fact, they may even complement your outgoing nature and join your escapades. Therefore, do not think of dismissing Capricorn as a partner. Give them a chance, the union between the two of you has a potential to blossom."
