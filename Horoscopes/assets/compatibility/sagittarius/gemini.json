  "compatibility": "Sagittarius and Gemini is a very fascinating combination, since both of you exhibit similar attributes. First, you are both naturally inconsistent, and you always expect variety and considerable change in life. This is  important for a strong emotional and mental state for the both of you. Gemini prefers the intellectual view of life while you lean toward a broader perception. These differences come in handy when it comes to traveling. When both of you get together, your life becomes a vortex tour, with lots of unexpected turns. Your relationship can be a pleasant one as both of you love change, frequent moves, surprises, adventures, and adjustments. This combination may easily lead to a long-term relationship and marriage. However, because of your inconsistent nature, it would take a while to make any firm decisions about your future. You are also a big flirt which will make Gemini feel insecure. Both of you are bad tempered and sarcastic, which can cause a lot of tension in the union. It looks like your relationship will call for a lot of work. However, if you permit each other the freedom of exploration of your individual interests, your relationship is likely to grow into something wonderful and long-lasting."
