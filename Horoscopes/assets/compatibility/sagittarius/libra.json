  "compatibility": "There is something unique about Sagittarius and Libra combination. There is an instant sense of ease and general feeling of comfort. Moreover, Libra will demonstrate what it means to be a good friend. They have an ability to slowly polish the rough side of you and turn you to the valuable Sagittarian that you really are. There are some similarities between Libra and Sagittarius that make both of you truly enjoy diversity and change. With this, you will be able to give Libra the variety and excitement that they need. This is particularly important when it relates to other people, since Libra values their relationship. You may choose to go on vacations together or for long walks in the  beautiful surroundings. This will enable both of you to slip into emotional and interesting discussions, which are very important for the well being of any Libra. The two of you might meet when traveling, on holiday or at a bus station. This is because both of you love going on a journey and this might be an important element in your first encounter. Sagittarius  can be very romantic when in a relationship. However, you have to be very careful to avoid pushing Libra too far out of their comfort zone."
