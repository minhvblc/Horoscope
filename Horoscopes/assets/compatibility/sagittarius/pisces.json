  "compatibility": "Sagittarius and Pisces have an immediate understanding of each other, because you share similar ideas. Pisces is sensitive, dreamy and mystical. This is what appeals to Sagittarian's idealism, since you both believe that there is a deeper sense to life. You are likely to get a stronger connection based on your common interests. However, there are some differences between the two of you. For instance, Sagittarians are more outgoing and fiery and this could at times push the easygoing and receptive Pisces to a retaliation point. It will take Pisces some time to adjust to your environment because they generally prefer things going at their own pace. This is the opposite of you, because you like to do things right away. This difference might be the sticky point in this relationship. Pisces can relate to your domestic life, this is mainly because they love familiar surroundings. Pisces is eager to start up a family and settle down to live a quiet and happy life. This does not mean that you will not enjoy discovering the world together. Pisces will soothe your volatile restlessness and tempestuous nature, while you will introduce them to the excitement and thrill of life. Both of you have similar emotional aspirations. This can result in thrilling moments for both of you in either outdoor or indoor activities. This can turn out to be a perfect match."
