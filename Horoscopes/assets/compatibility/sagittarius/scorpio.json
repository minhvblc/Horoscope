  "compatibility": "Sagittarius and Scorpio are terrific mates, because they are extremely compatible. This combination is great, full of fun, optimism and achievements. You both have a positive approach toward life, and if you put your hearts and minds together, you will be able to achieve a lot. Sagittarian's daring and outgoing attitude will make Scorpio feel somewhat wary during your first meeting. Scorpio is a little bit serious and needs some time to adjust. In case you fall in love with Scorpio, the outcome might be explosive. You must be patient enough to wait for Scorpio to come out of the shell. You can teach Scorpio how to express their emotions. If you want this relationship to last, stick to an emotional ground rule. Fortunately, Scorpio will enjoy the more optimistic and lighter side of life once they learn to be flexible. Sagittarius's love for outdoor activities and travel will give Scorpio a taste of freedom and open their eyes to variety. Your love life can be very exciting, but only when Scorpio discovers that your bluntness and openness does not mean that you are planning to take advantage of your partner."
