  "compatibility": "Both of you are inconsistent, which makes you flexible and adaptable beings. Due to this fact, you are likely to have a very successful relationship, even though the two of you are so different. Sagittarius is a big picture kind of person, who is metaphorically speaking, concerned with the entire \"forest\", while Virgo always pays attention to every small detail. Virgo is concentrated on every single tree, maybe even each leaf on the tree. This does not necessarily mean that this relationship cannot work. In fact, you can handle each other easily, especially if you learn to understand and accept each other's views.  Virgo has to learn not to be so critical about every small thing and learn to look at the result and not so much at the process. Sagittarius on the other hand, should focus more on the process and not the outcome. This could be equally difficult for both of you but looking on the positive side, it is worth trying. Virgo is a great partner for Sagittarius in terms of work. However, you will be required to stay put, and increase your interest in domestic chores, if you want to satisfy the needs of Virgo. Therefore, put more effort in your work and career to bring more harmony and understanding in a family situation."
