  "compatibility": "The union between Scorpio and Aries is bound to be very steamy. The relationship between the two of you is likely to be romantic, as you will be attracted to each other's passionate side. Not everything is painted pink though. Scorpio, you are a sensitive sign, very different from your Aries partner, which will make it somewhat hard to connect emotionally. Aries is known to be quite hot headed and stubborn. Power comes into play in the relationship between the two of you, as Aries will generally try to dominate. Although your astrological element is water, you are far from being cool and fluent. Both Scorpio and Aries are strong willed and you will have to compromise to get anything done. Conflicts will naturally arise due to your different personalities. While Aries likes to party and have a life full of fun, there are times Scorpio would rather enjoy peace and quiet, which Aries might find boring. You will also constantly disagree about how things should be done, because each of you want to express your superiority. However you can leave it behind you, once you realize how important your passionate relationship is."
