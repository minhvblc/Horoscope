  "compatibility": "Scorpio and Cancer are both water elements, and this makes it easier for the two of you to get along. The relationship between Scorpio and Cancer is comfortable, since neither of you have to impress the other. The attraction between the two of you is mutual and the relationship is one of the best Scorpio could have with any other sign. You have the same traits as Cancer does. Both of you are caring, emotional and sensitive. However, when it comes to love, you would feel that you give much more than you receive. Cancer is very adaptable and can cope with some of the characteristics of Scorpio that are not very pleasant, such as oppressiveness and possessiveness. However, you should be more considerate and avoid taking advantage of Cancer, as this could easily break your relationship. You are naturally driven by passion, whereas Cancer yearns for emotional attachment before they can show their passion. Despite some of the traits of Scorpio that usually put people off, Cancer tends to tolerate them no matter what. Cancer has a great connection with Scorpio on a whole different level, which makes them endearing to Scorpio. It also enables you to open up. The relationship between the two of you may last a lifetime."
