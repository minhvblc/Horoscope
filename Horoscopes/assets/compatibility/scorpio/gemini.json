  "compatibility": "Gemini is an air sign and you are water, and together it creates rain. So get ready for quite an intense ride. Gemini is known to be intellectual, lighthearted, changeable, unstable and superficial. You, Scorpio, on the other hand, prefer deep discussions which cannot be sustained when talking with Gemini. The ability of Gemini to take things lightly can get on Scorpio's nerves. You could even assume that your partner is not serious about you. You need all the patience you have to fully understand how to deal with Gemini. The relationship between the two of you can teach you to let go and have fun once in a while. With Gemini, one can also learn not to judge a book by its cover. As much as Gemini loves having fun, it should not be assumed that they are indifferent, but rather that Gemini has their own way of self expression. You are extremely compatible in the bedroom as both of you are passionate and willing to try new things. All in all this can be a very fruitful relationship for you, where you could learn a lot an have tons of fun as well."
