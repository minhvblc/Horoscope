  "compatibility": "The two of you are a perfect match. You have the same traits and share the same way of thinking. You possess the same kind of passion, which will naturally draw you to each other. Your similarities will make you very endearing to each other. You are so fond of each other that you literally want to spend every waking moment together. Despite your mutual attraction, you may still run into some problems due to the fact, that you are both very strong willed individuals. Both of you are very controlling, extremely demanding and overly possessive. If you overcome your hotheaded nature, compromise and work out your problems, your relationship can grow into a long lasting partnership. You know each other so well that you are able to understand each other's weaknesses and work as a team to support one another. Beware of your possessive nature. You both require undivided attention and loyalty from each other and the smallest issue could make you suspicious. This might stifle your relationship, unless you chose to trust your partner completely and leave no room for doubts."
