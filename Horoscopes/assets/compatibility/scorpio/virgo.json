  "compatibility": "The relationship between Scorpio and Virgo is set to be successful if the two of you decide to make it a team effort, rather than leaving only one of you to deal with all your problems. This union may not last long because each of you are too demanding and fussy. Your Virgo partner might choose to solve issues rationally, while you would rather impose your will on your lover. The habit of Virgo to constantly analyze situations usually gets on your nerves. You can be insensitive and at times have no respect for other divergent views. If you could learn to let go of your controlling streak, you might have a wonderful romance with Virgo, as Virgo portrays all the traits that are necessary for a lasting relationship. Just like Scorpio, Virgo knows how to manage their finances properly, so the financial situation of the two of you is likely to be smooth. Despite the hardships that you two may face, your relationship is likely to be very romantic. Much compromise is needed though if you have the intention of making this relationship work out in a long term."
