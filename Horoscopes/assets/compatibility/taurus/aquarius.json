  "compatibility": "Aquarius has a careless attitude, especially when it comes to love. This will not only shock, but also enrage Taurus, who is very passionate and is not looking for someone to simply play around with. Aquarius will find you, Taurus, to be very demanding and needy. Aquarius opts for an intellectual communication, while Taurus prefers to be physical. You can be quite pushy when you are angry, and Aquarius tends to pull away. Conservative Taurus appreciates security and family, while Aquarius is progressive and eager to try new things. Aquarius has a fascination with human concerns, while on the other hand, Taurus remains narrow minded. The big ideas of Aquarius that border crazy, may have a major impact on the career of more conservative Taurus. Aquarius has an honest concern about the aspirations and ambitions of Taurus, and this makes the relationship harmonious in the professional areas. Your stubborn nature may kill the relationship eventually, unless you are both willing to sit down, listen and discuss issues in a logical manner. Taurus and Aquarius both face emotional ups and downs that they rarely can contain, and as a result, your relationship can face many issues and problems. Even though Aquarius may lead Taurus to a new and adventurous path, Taurus may not be willing to follow."
