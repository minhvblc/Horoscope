  "compatibility": "The two of you have very different personalities. Taurus does not appreciate being pushed and takes time on things, which is the total opposite of Aries. Taurus does not share the imagination Aries possesses, and in most cases will find it difficult to meet the expectations that Aries has. Aries is full of life and loves entertainment, while Taurus is more of an introvert; the two of you have to map out a plan that works for the both of you. Your relationship will be fiery and hot, if Taurus is willing to let emotions act as a guide. Taurus loves spending money, while Aries on the other hand is not a big spender. You should let Aries take the leading role for the two of you to reach the balance point in the relationship. Taurus, who spends much time away from people, finds it more comfortable to share the seclusion with Aries. Taurus is drawn to the vitality in Aries, while Aries finds the ability of Taurus to think things over, make quick decisions and appreciate life very impressive. Aries sparks a dramatic excitement to Taurus and the mystery is fascinating. The two of you have plenty to offer to each other."
