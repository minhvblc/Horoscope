  "compatibility": "Taurus most often prefers to take their time, when deciding on a mate, while Libra is easily swayed into a relationship by as aggressive and sexual mate as Taurus. Taurus and Libra differ in the style of self-expression. They may even find each other's opposite ways of self-portraying be repulsive to the other. This however, is not a cause for any alarm, as they can both compromise easily for the sake of the relationship. Libra and Taurus love to indulge in the pleasures of life, but Libra is more indulging than Taurus. This makes this couple able to go out for romantic diners and other fun activities. If the physical connection is not great initially, the understanding and emotional warmth of Libra will help to solve any physical problems between the two of you. Libra is a highly romantic being and may find it difficult to commit to a partner due to their indecisive nature. They keep wondering if they have made the right choice or not. Taurus needs and desires a calm partner, and since Libra is a natural born peacemaker, this makes them suited for each other, since they detest uncouth behavior. Libra is more diplomatic when dealing with issues, while Taurus is more practical when solving problems. Libra enjoys sharing intimate moments with their partner, while Taurus are the silent types, yet it doesn't make them less sensual or sexual."
