  "compatibility": "Both of you are stubborn and jealous and you share a strange compatibility. Taurus wants to be in charge, while Scorpio wants to call the shots, but on more emotional level. You both have a powerful sexual appeal, this happens to be a common ground for both of you, and neither is likely to cheat on the other. Taurus is known to get very stubborn when irritated, while on the other hand, Scorpio gets temperamental when annoyed. However, there is a chance of this relationship to unfold quite well. The two of you can make each other happy. This connection can also lead to a successful and prolonged marriage. However, unless the two of you are willing to be tolerant with each other, you will not be able to walk through the stormy occasions. There are higher chances of the relationship ending with each of you taking a different path. If Taurus seeks quiet and peace, then Scorpio is not the best match. Scorpio is good at initiating projects, and this may be what Taurus needs at specific times. Scorpio has the capability of changing the ways and appearance of Taurus. You should be well aware that a relationship with Scorpio would demand major adjustments to be made in your lifestyle, and consider whether you will be willing to undergo those."
