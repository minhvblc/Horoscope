  "compatibility": "The union between Taurus and Taurus is an exciting one. This is simply because you are one of the signs that is compatible with itself for steamy, romantic relationship. Both of you find adventure to be extremely fun. The two of you are very sentimental, especially when it comes to love, while Taurus prefers to stay in the company of the opposite sex and is naturally a flirt. You cannot tolerate lack of attention or deceit. Both of you love money and will work hard to get it. You are not afraid to share affection and are very loyal. One way to make this union work to its best is by finding friends and hobbies outside the relationship, in order to avoid clinging on to each other. While this connection has a great potential and you will probably have many enjoyable and exciting moments together, there are doubts of a marriage holding on. Marriage, or even long term relationship requires certain things to be worked on. The two of you however, tend to be good at socializing, rather than getting any work done. Both of you need to know where and when to draw the line, when dealing with each other."
