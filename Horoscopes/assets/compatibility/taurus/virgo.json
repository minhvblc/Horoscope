  "compatibility": "The moment the two of you meet, it will be love at first sight. You both share similar intellectual pursuits. Both of you are home lovers. Taurus has a physical nature that is revealing and strong, while Virgo has a sharp mind. If two of you are brought together, you become an ultimate story of success. Each has the ability to understand and respond to the needs of the other party, and this brings you closer. Taurus is adventurous when it comes to lovemaking, while Virgo prefers to keep it simple. You need to exercise some compromise on their different perspectives of life, if you want to work this out. Taurus is very particular when it comes to finances and spending, while Virgo is the exact opposite. This relationship is safe and great and can lead to a successful marriage, but in order for this to happen you both have to be patient. The two of you share a passion for arts and the creative subjects. The weaknesses and negative traits of Virgo work to the advantage of Taurus and vice versa, as it brings out the best qualities in you both. Taurus needs to work on a balance between emotions and intellect. The two of you are attracted to each other physically, and this is a good sign, as it will be a unifying factor."
