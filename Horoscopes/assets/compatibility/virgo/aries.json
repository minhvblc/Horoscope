  "compatibility": "It seems that Virgo and Aries have nothing in common, but if you overcome initial differences, you will realize that you both can learn a lot from each other. At first, dominant and aggressive Aries may scare shy and reserved Virgo. Aries is impulsive and brash, which can intimidate warm and compliant Virgo. The differences, however, cannot hold you back from making a good combination. Both of you share strong energy that can break any barriers holding you apart. Virgo always wants to have a plan in hand and does not like leaving things for fate to decide, whereas Aries craves for excitement and lets things work out on their own. Though you have different styles, there are things you can learn from each other, if you decide to be more open. Aries can learn about the importance of being orderly, while Virgo can be highly motivated by Aries. You can connect on more than one aspect, since the two of you are honest and dislike going against your moral values. Uneasy moments can occur in the relationship due to Virgo's constant criticism and bringing up past mistakes. Virgo analyzes too much, which makes Aries impatient and may opt to quit the relationship. If these two personalities were to rub together, they will most certainly generate friction, because both have different ways of handling situations."
