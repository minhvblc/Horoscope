  "compatibility": "These zodiac signs are rational and intellectual. Both of you like to communicate and appreciate each other's humor. This partnership is lively as Gemini adds sparks to the interaction; they are constantly set to venture into different ideas without any serious aim. Virgo, you keep a low profile in this combination, you are careful and cannot take baseless risks for the sake of gaining experience. Mercury (the planet of communication) rules both Virgo and Gemini. Gemini represents its masculine side, while dependable Virgo takes on Mercury's feminine aspect. Gemini is a risk taker, while Virgo takes everything too seriously and thinks twice before getting into something. What truly connects these signs is humor and intellectual discussion. Gemini always makes Virgo laugh, while Virgo provides a much needed emotional anchor. Virgo tends to be earnest and practical most of the time, and Gemini is capable of breaking this routine. Gemini may feel that Virgo is at times too boring. Virgo may get feed up with Gemini's split personalities and constant change of mind. Gemini often looks for a reason to start an argument, because they are restless in a relationship. Gemini does not mind working in a disorganized place, while Virgo is a perfectionist, who must have everything in order, before beginning any work. Compromise will be vital in this union."
