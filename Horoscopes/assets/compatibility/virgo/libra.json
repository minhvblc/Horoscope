  "compatibility": "When Virgo and Libra come together it is a tough match. They are two opposites. Virgo is interested in material things way more than in romance or sex, which drives Libra crazy. Virgo prefers to stay at home, while Libra is very outgoing and social. Libra finds Virgo critical and inflexible. Frugal Virgo, in turn, refuses to understand Libra's expensive taste. On the other hand, these signs have some things in common. When in relationship, you both seek security. You both love arts, beauty and culture. If you learn to respect and appreciate each other's differences, you can have a successful and stable partnership. Libra may be the cushion you can lean on when feeling restless. Libra companion can absorb criticism and outbursts from you and will not react ruthlessly. Libra can also be an excellent listener, while Virgo is a good analyst and thinker. Together you can join your forces and come up with an optimal solution to any problem. These qualities are somewhat favorable for mutual business venture, but it will work best in a short term project since your mixture is simply too volatile."
