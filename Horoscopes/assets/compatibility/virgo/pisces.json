  "compatibility": "Opposites attract and it can be hard to separate them. This means it does not matter how different Pisces and Virgo are. This combination is suitable for a long-term relationship and usually will lead to a successful and satisfying marriage. With different temperaments, it is quite surprising how the two of you can have a long-lasting affair. Pisces is a water sign, which makes them sensitive and spontaneous. While you Virgo, are usually insecure, intelligent and inexpressive, holding back too many emotions. If you decide to try pairing with Pisces, you should express feelings clearly and should be enticing, though you might be hesitant at first. Change in personality is important, if you want this relationship to work. Pisces lives in a fantasy world, always dreaming of having a better life. Whereas Virgo is different and prefers being more practical. Virgo believes in being realistic and actively doing something, rather than dreaming about it. Virgo and Pisces are both unpredictable and often have mood swings. Pisces solves problems by relying on personal intuitions and emotions, while Virgo solves problems logically, basing them on facts. Because Pisces is calm and soft, you will try to impose your rules upon your partner. Although Pisces rarely attacks back, it does not mean you did not hurt them. Limit your controlling nature, if you want to avoid scaring them off."
