  "compatibility": "When it comes to love, Sagittarius focuses more on a bigger picture, while intellectual Virgo tends to concentrate on details. Virgo looks for order and simplicity, whereas Sagittarius needs excitement and new experiences. At the same time, both of you can change and adapt to new demands from your partner. In addition, Sagittarius easily adapts to the needs that Virgo has, because Sagittarius is more flexible and is not afraid of change. Nevertheless, it is hard for Virgo to change, because they need too much pampering. Due to Sagittarius natural adaptability, you will most likely have a flourishing relationship. This is even more likely to happen if Virgo learns to accept Sagittarius views, and the same applies to Sagittarius, though Virgo does not like change. You will drain your partner with constant demands and obligations. Although you need Sagittarius to support all your ideas for self-satisfaction, you have to realize that in a relationship mutual understanding is vital. You have to let go of desiring perfectionism in love and life. You should learn that in a relationship it is better to see the overall picture, rather than trying to mould it to how you feel it should be. Although you are quite different, you can become a very well-rounded couple. If you combine your pragmatic mind with Sagittarius's energy and curiosity, you will have a powerful, long-lasting relationship."
