  "compatibility": "When these two meet, this is love at first sight. You have a lot in common: both of you are down-to-earth and materialistic, and you share high intellect pursuits. Both of you are stay-at-home people who love comfort. Virgo and Taurus are both practical and share responsibilities when combined. In a relationship, Virgo will take care of expenditures, while Taurus cautiously caters to other miscellaneous activities. Devotion is vital in this combination, where Taurus is strong emotionally and very nurturing as well. Virgo really appreciates this gesture, is patient and this places both of you in charge of the relationship. The major priority to both these signs is managing finances and if done properly, you will have a successful marriage. Financial misunderstandings rarely affect this combination, since both give material security a high priority. Both feel relaxed if only there is enough money to sustain their personal needs. Being practical is essential to these earthy signs. Forming a solid and firm combination that cannot easily dismantle is also the key to a strong relationship. Taurus may be fussy at times, and this may come as a surprise to Virgo, who can get frustrated. Nevertheless, both of you share many common interests that will compensate the differences. You are perfectionists and love traveling. Despite the small differences, this relationship has every chance of surviving and turning into successful and a long lasting one."
