  "compatibility": "You are both outgoing and friendly. Both of you are utterly opposed to any form of injustice. Aries craving for adventure and the free spirit of Aquarius make you a very compatible couple. On the other hand, you both like to be a leader and will try to take the dominant role in the relationship, which may result in some confrontation. Ruled by Mars, Aries likes to command and always tries to take the lead, while free spirited Aquarius refuses to follow. Sometimes you find yourselves not able to connect at the spiritual or psychological level. However you are an exceptional match when it comes to intellect. Being both extroverts that enjoy other people's company more than intimacy, Aquarius and Aries enjoy activities that bring people together. Aquarian's craving for excitement is a big turn on for Aries, who loves adventure. When it comes to dealing with day to day situations, you may realize that you are way too different. All these small things, negligible for you, but important for much more practical Aries, could make it difficult for the two of you to establish a deeper understanding. However, if you both learn to overlook this difference, Aries's masculinity will connect perfectly with the romantic escapades in Aquarius. This combination can be quite explosive in both good and bad ways, but with adequate communication and helpful guidelines, a relationship between the two of you will last for years to come."
