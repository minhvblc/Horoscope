Aquarius on the other hand, is drawn to Leo's playfulness, warmth and sociability. One similarity that you and Leo share is that you are both quite stubborn. This makes you unwilling to compromise, even when your relationship is at stakes. Despite some differences, a relationship between the two of you will stand a chance if you will both learn to adjust a bit to one another. For instance, Aquarius will need to manage their time better, as Leo does not like to wait. In turn, Leo should accept that Aquarius often dances to their own tune. Additionally, Leo should not be too possessive toward you, and should try to be fresh and conventional as well. Leo stands to benefit from this relationship as you will help them loosen up and start living."
