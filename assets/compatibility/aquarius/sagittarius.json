  "compatibility": "Both Aquarius and Sagittarius enjoy each other's company and share many common interests; hence when paired together the union can be very productive. Both of you take pleasure in social functions and are willing to venture into unknown territories. A relationship between Aquarius and Sagittarius is likely to work out as you both love to socialize and to be right in the middle of any ongoing action. Outdoor games, theatre, entertainment and clubs make both of you tick. Although Aquarius is very social, you can be aloof at times. Your detachment from the world might make it difficult for you to adapt to Sagittarius at first, as Sagittarius is known to be enthusiastic, affectionate and self assured. When Sagittarius's planet Jupiter and your planet Uranus come together they provide a combination of optimism, hope and excitement for your relationship. You both will be up for some wild experimentations in the bedroom. Your sex life will never turn into a routine. Since Sagittarius loves traveling, you might find yourself traveling and exploring by their side within no time. You can be systematic in the way you do most things, but you also like to change your pace and/or direction radically which might throw Sagittarius off for some time. Don't worry about it, Sagittarius will adapt quickly. A relationship between Aquarius and Sagittarius is favored by stars despite the minor character differences."
