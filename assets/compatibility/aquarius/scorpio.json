  "compatibility": "Intense arguments are the order of the day, when Aquarius and Scorpio are placed together in the same room. You do not want to welcome suggestions from Scorpio and neither do they want to accept yours, because you both believe that your ideas are the best and smartest. You are too used to be following your own rules. The distance between you and your partner equals the distance from the infinity of the skies to the deepest abyss of the earth. Scorpio is known for their ability to control situations and turn them in their favor. Scorpio will master the craft of controlling Aquarian social life, because you hate invasion to your privacy. This turbulent union cannot usually last for very long, since none of you want to compromise your own independence. Aquarius is able to move to the next partner after the relationship with Scorpio, because you do not have much emotional attachment like Scorpio does. Scorpio does not appreciate Aquarius's thirst for power, thus the two of you will work better in a relationship based on friendship, rather than a romantic setting."
