  "compatibility": "Although there is immediate mutual fascination with each other, your personalities are very different. Taurus is conservative, yet non-conformist and down to earth while Aquarius is outspoken and free spirited. Taurus may seem too rigid and stuck-up for a quick changing Aquarius. Sometimes it is hard for a Bull to accept new ideas. Also, Taurus is a very possessive sign, which can drive a free spirited and careless in love Aquarius crazy. Taurus is very down-to-earth and prefers concerns with the day-to-day matters, while Aquarius's big ideas and thoughts always revolve around future. Despite all the differences, this relationship might work, because Taurus can help you to better manage your time and money and you, in turn, can help your partner to see the bigger picture of things. You can also teach Taurus to be more flexible. Even if this relationship does not work out, there is still great possibility for a friendship, as you complement each other perfectly on levels that are less important for a romantic involvement."
