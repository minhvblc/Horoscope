  "compatibility": "You are very compatible intellectually and you also share many common interests with Virgo, but it won't be easy for you two to share a deep emotional bond. The two of you have a completely different approach to life. While you look at the world on the grand scheme of things and always try to come up with new solutions to any problems, a rational Virgo prefers to work on the small and specific areas, applying old and try-and-true methods. Both of you are humanitarians, but while you can only think globally, Virgo tends to favor locality. Virgo can be too conservative and \"safe\" for a free spirited Aquarius, who does not want to commit and be locked up in a relationship. Friction between the two of you is caused by neglect, usually felt by Virgo when you are away attending different social events. The tendency of being late which is in your nature (you can not do much about it), can also be a problem for a punctual Virgo. They may often feel offended by your inability to manage your time. However, Virgo should be cautious when criticizing Aquarius, for you do not respond well to criticism and feel undermined. All negative aspects aside, you tend to work well and support each other toward the invention and implementation of new ideas in any professional or personal combinations. The romantic connection is much trickier  and will require some serious amount of work."
