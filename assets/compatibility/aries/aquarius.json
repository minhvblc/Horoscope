  "compatibility": "Aries and Aquarius are both independent and therefore will need extra room to grow and to be able to express themselves. You desire a relationship that is based on respect and understanding. Aquarius is a social butterfly and a humanitarian, and these qualities will fascinate Aries. Your signs are friendly and outgoing. You love truth and fairness. The free spirited nature of Aquarius strongly appeals to Aries's desire for adventure and action. Both of you love being in charge and will likely take up a position of authority or leadership. You complement each other very well. Aquarius's need for variety and excitement resonates well with Aries's thirst for thrill and adventure. The connection between you two is based more on the intellectual level, rather than on emotions or sentiments. Friends, group involvement and sports are common interests that you share. You, Aries, have a strong personality and a strong ego. People may regard you as being self-absorbed and selfish. On the other hand, Aquarius is deeply concerned with humanitarian matters and, unlike you, is keener to help a larger group of people. You, unlike your partner, prefer to deal with one person at a time. If you keep communication lines open, your union will be enjoyable and long lasting."
