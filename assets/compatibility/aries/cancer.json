  "compatibility": "If you enter into a relationship with Cancer, you have to brace yourself for frequent misunderstandings and ego clashes. Cancer is very sensitive and emotional and will need to be reassured constantly. Due to the fact that you, Aries, are independent and impatient, it is unlikely that you will be able to fulfill Cancer's wishes. The two of you have different ways of expressing yourselves. That creates a challenge in the relationship. Cancer is soft, nurturing, considerate, maternal and caring. Occasionally, Cancer may confuse your independent nature and think of you as insensitive, bossy and inconsiderate. These feelings may cause Cancer to resent Aries and, in the end, make them unwilling to continue with the relationship. Aries will often be frustrated since Cancer is prone to severe mood swings. Romantically, you have to be sensitive and caring, as Cancer is usually sensual and responsive. Both of your zodiac signs are light on their feet and outgoing. Both of you can be flexible and adjust easily to new situations. Cancer is more home loving and will be able to provide Aries with a well-kept home and delicious home cooked meal. The combination between Aries and Cancer comes out best during emergency situations. Aries is also likely to assume the role of a provider, whereas Cancer tends to concentrate on being a homemaker."
