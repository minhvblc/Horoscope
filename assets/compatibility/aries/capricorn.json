  "compatibility": "Aries and Capricorn make a very tough combination. You are outgoing extrovert, while Capricorn is shy introvert. Aries is fired up and ready to take any challenge, while Capricorn is methodological and prefers to write down plans before undertaking any major decision. The way you express yourselves is quite different and this can be very frustrating for both of you. You may even give up on the relationship, if any slight misunderstanding arises. The draw back of this union is that Aries will make a decision in the twinkle of an eye. On the other hand, Capricorn will find these decisions foolish and unsound. Capricorn will take too long to be decisive and this will not suit the quick nature of Aries. Aries prefers taking risks, they find pleasure at going for the unknown. At times, Capricorn seems to appear aloof and cold to Aries, since they do not express their emotions in an open way. Capricorn is not as excited as Aries when it comes to new challenges. This makes the impatient Aries feel very frustrated. Capricorn is serious and responsible at all times. This makes them loyal and very dependable in relationships, though they lack the fun and spontaneity desired by Aries. The sooner both of you accept your differences, the sooner you will find ways of reducing or eliminating conflicts that may arise."
