  "compatibility": "The relationship between Aries and Leo is represented by fire, which results in an immediate attraction between the two of you. You clearly understand the character traits each of you bear, which makes this combination excellent physically, emotionally and mentally as well. Though the relationship may be explosive, you will find an equilibrium for your self-expression and ego drives. Between the two of you, nothing will be difficult if you combine your efforts toward any tough problem. Both of you are outgoing, active, and personable, which helps you to relate nicely with each other. You are driven with strong creative desires, that put you in an excellent position, where you are able to appreciate and support the ambitions and goals harbored by one another. You will easily achieve your individual ambitions, when you help each other, instead of working against each other. Since Leo is domineering and proud just like Aries, the foundation of the relationship must be built on love and respect. This is because eventually conflicts will arise and you will try to determine who is in charge. However, as long as the relationship continues to be based on mutual respect and understanding, such issues will be resolved amicably. In addition to all that, since you also share a common element, which is fire, the union between the two of you promises to be truly rewarding and fulfilling."
