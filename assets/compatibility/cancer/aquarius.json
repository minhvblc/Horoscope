  "compatibility": "It is in the nature of Cancer to be very sensitive and nurturing while Aquarius is not quite in touch with emotions and is more intellectual in their outlook on life. Aquarius chooses thoughts over emotions. The Aquarius enjoys various social/group activities such as interacting with friends. This sign can be very spontaneous, which is somewhat destabilizing for Cancer. Therefore, you can expect anything from Aquarius. You will be the nurturing and understanding one in this relationship. You will cater to any emotional needs Aquarius has. You enjoy getting away from the hassles and bustles of life to unwind, while the idea of a leisurely getaway for Aquarius is to go for a social event. To avoid clashing over this, it is advisable to look for a middle ground, which will satisfy both of you. When the two of you can finally agree on something, it is impossible to keep you apart. Any business venture that may be initiated between you is likely to prosper, because of good cohesion on the business front. Both of you are innovative and thus capable of imposing new ideas to grow a business. Aquarius and Cancer have a certain ability that allows them to face situations head on without any fear of prejudice."
