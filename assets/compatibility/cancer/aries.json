  "compatibility": "The major aspects that come to the fore with this pairing have to do with misunderstanding and ego clashing. The reason for this is that you two have very divergent points of view. The temperament and emotional nature of Cancer require plenty of reassurance and some sensitivity from Aries. This, however, cannot be sufficiently fulfilled by Aries who is independent and spontaneous. Many times, Cancer may perceive Aries's independent and free flowing nature as inconsideration or bossiness. As a result of this, Aries could build up some kind of resentment as a counteractive measure. Cancer has moods that fluctuate from day to day, which may cause emotional strain on both sides. On a positive note, Aries is likely to be treated to a well-maintained house and home-cooked meals, as Cancers make good homemakers. For this union to succeed, Aries will be required to develop a sense of patience because Cancer is always ready and willing to kiss and make up. The main similarity between Cancer and Aries has to do with handling of emergencies, which both of you do with excellence. The two of you can make good business partners as well. An ideal situation for this pairing in a romantic setting is for Cancer to be the homemaker, while Aries maintains the role of a breadwinner."
