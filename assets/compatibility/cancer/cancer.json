  "compatibility": "The two of you are loving and caring individuals and this is exhibited through the need to attend to one another's needs. This can create a good foundation for a family setting. The two of you are receptive to the immediate environment and you are ready to make a difference in each other's lives. This is likely to make a good combination because you are able to lift up each other's moods during difficult times. There is a sense of giving between you, and you prefer to participate in charitable activities and giving back to the community. You are comfortable in your love life, and sensitivity is expressed on both sides. This is a good match but it could get too monotonous if the two of you are too much alike. Some time should be spent apart when things hit a rough patch. Both of you are dancers and enjoy great music, which stimulates your emotions. You are also likely to be good actors. Confrontations may be minimal because Cancers are afraid of being rejected. This combination could either fail in its initial stages or flourish over long periods. The way you communicate will determine the strength of the union."
