  "compatibility": "Gemini has a more intellectual outlook on life while you rely on emotions and intuition to decipher various issues. For this bond to flourish, it is necessary for both parties to accept the divergent views and personalities that are held by the other person. This is the only way that the bond is able to last. Cancer is caring, considerate and sentimental, while Gemini is talkative, flirtatious and very spontaneous. Family-oriented Cancer needs a steady relationship with a partner that can offer sufficient support. Gemini is likely to be the less stable party, since they tend to change their minds often and in an instant. They also tend to get their emotions tangled in love and sexual issues. Cancer needs to connect with Gemini on a cognitive level otherwise there may not be any understanding between the two. You are best suited to Geminis who are more open with their inner feelings. Gemini is not very reasonable when it comes to financial issues and in this pairing Cancer should be the one dealing with such matters. Cancer is likely to be the one to get jealous in this relationship and this could cause quarrels instigated by you, Cancer. Despite significant differences, there is potential that this relationship could turn out to be a successful and long-lasting one."
