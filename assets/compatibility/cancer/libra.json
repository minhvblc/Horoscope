  "compatibility": "The relationship between the two of you is bound to grow and develop because both of your signs are cardinal. Your sensitiveness and emotions can blend well with the social and cognitive prowess of Libra. No matter what gender, Libras have the ability to attract others with their natural grace and charm. Libra can easily get bored if things seem to become lacklustre. Therefore it is necessary for you to keep your partner always interested and have something to look forward to. You are more comfortable in a domestic setting while Libra is a go-getter and can be all over the place. Money is also a major issue for Libra, who is somewhat materialistic. Misunderstandings may appear because of Libra's liberal nature, which is in contrast to the nature of Cancer, who is quiet and has a reclusive disposition. Libra is likely to consider you as a setback to their lifestyle and ambition. This could be remedied by doing things that will involve the two of you. Libra may take this well because it is something that can keep the relationship moving to greater heights. Since the two signs correspond to feminine planets (Venus and Moon), there is likely to be great intimacy involved in the relationship."
