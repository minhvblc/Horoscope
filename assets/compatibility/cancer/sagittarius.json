  "compatibility": "Cancer is a water sign and Sagittarius is fire sign, which creates a questionable combination. Sagittarius is a free spirit, who enjoys the spice of life, while Cancer is more emotive and reserved. This difference may become apparent during interaction at social events, where Sagittarius will be all about mingling, while Cancer will be content to stay in a corner. Sagittarius has an uncanny way of being easily amused by almost every situation. They believe that everything happens for a reason. While your planet Moon makes you emotional and nurturing, Sagittarius's Jupiter is all about expansion, travel and wandering. A business partnership would not be a good idea due to Sagittarius domineering nature. Cancer would be relegated to the background and would not be able to stand this kind of situation. This relationship is not likely to prosper in the long term and Sagittarius may mention this bluntly. The frankness and criticism of Sagittarius affect Cancer in a negative way and could cause the relationship to end. For things to work out, Sagittarius needs to learn how to be diplomatic and tactful. Cancer on the other hand, needs to develop a thick skin to be able to handle some of the brashness from Sagittarius."
