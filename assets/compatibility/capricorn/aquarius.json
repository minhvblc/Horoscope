  "compatibility": "The two of you need to develop an enhanced comprehension of the traits each of you hold, in order to establish a sound relationship. You have some differences, but through compromise, you will be able to cope with each other. Capricorn may have a difficult time stabilizing the free-spirited lifestyle of Aquarius, but at the end, Aquarius will benefit from this grounding. Capricorn is apprehensive about their accomplishments, which is in contrast with Aquarius, who is more concerned with mankind at a global level. This means that Capricorn will toil hard with a promise of self gain, while Aquarius is satisfied when they feel that there is fair and equal treatment of others. Both Aquarius and Capricorn possess similar traits in relation to politics and humanitarian causes. Aquarius will be more involved in humanitarian causes that uplift the lives of many, while Capricorn will be more involved in political causes that promise an opportunity for self gain. It is important for Aquarius to remember that Capricorn likes routine and order, since they prefer to work according to a plan. This might cause problems, because Aquarius finds it difficult to stick to schedules. In relation to work, Aquarius is more freelance in nature than Capricorn, who likes more permanent forms of work. Both of you should adopt open lines of communication in order for the relationship to last."
