  "compatibility": "Libra takes a gentle logical approach to life, while Capricorn has more serious methodical nature. This might cause some problems to arise, when the two of you have a relationship. You may have the same intellectual approaches, but the conflict comes from the way in which you both express yourselves. Sometimes, Capricorn and Libra can not even be attracted to each other. Libra is an outgoing and talkative sign, while Capricorn is more reserved and detached. This often leaves Libra feeling uncomfortable or rejected, despite the fact that Capricorn can be an attentive listener. Libra needs Capricorn to display affection toward them, a feeling that Capricorn may unnecessarily deem  most of the time. Libra can teach Capricorn how they can deal with fear of getting in touch with their emotions. Libra is often more romantic than Capricorn, but you both exhibit signs of true romance in relationships. While you do not think that spending that much time with your Libra is important, your partner makes sure to set aside enough time for you. This may result in Libra feeling neglected, while you can feel that Libra is overly dependent. If these issues are not properly tackled, they may result in conflict which can lead to major disagreements."
