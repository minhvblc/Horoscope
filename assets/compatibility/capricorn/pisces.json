  "compatibility": "Pisces and Capricorn are often attracted to each other. They are very compatible in many aspects, thus a solid friendship can be formed, which may perhaps last for a long time. Pisces is more of a creative artist, while Capricorn is mainly an organizer. When the two of you mingle, you create realistic poetry. Capricorn is well grounded, and this can help the impractical Pisces to settle down. Pisces has a tendency to seclude themselves and drift away into their own world. You will have to understand that Pisces needs it to re-charge their soul. Capricorns like to work on their own, so that they can accomplish much of what they have set to do. Pisces is a sensitive, passionate and highly intuitive individual, while Capricorn exhibits a pessimistic persona, has great endurance powers and applies discipline to anything. Pisces is more romantic than Capricorn. Pisces may be disenchanted by Capricorn's aloof responses. And Pisces needs supple subtle empathy displayed in romantic gestures. You, on the other hand, may fail to express your feelings to Pisces making Pisces feel unappreciated. Pisces can use their softer side to sway you into getting in touch with your sentimental feelings and teach you how to express them without feeling bad. All Pisces has to do, is to inspire you, Capricorn, into seeing the beauty of expressing emotions to your partner."
