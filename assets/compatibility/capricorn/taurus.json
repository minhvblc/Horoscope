  "compatibility": "The two of you are very compatible, as you are both Earth signs. You share same ways of self-expression; you will see a lot of yourself in each other. You are both logical, practical, patient and very down-to-earth. When it comes to choosing a partner, both of you are serious and take your time in the process. Although you are very alike, you still have some differences. Taurus is well grounded but at the same time, they are more sensitive. Taurus is ruled by feminine Venus, which makes this sign sensual, nurturing and caring. Capricorn, on the other hand, ruled by cold Saturn, which makes you very goal-oriented, hard-working, disciplined overachiever. Capricorn always looks for a mate that has similar traits. This means that your partner should be aware of how to behave in public in a proper manner, since you have a more corporate behavior. You are naturally drawn to people who admire achievement or those, who have put practical goals. Once in a commitment, you are extremely faithful but you may find it difficult expressing your feelings. Taurus needs a dependable and loyal partner who is financially conscious, and will not take unsound financial risks. This makes Capricorn and Taurus to be compatible but on an emotional level, Taurus may not be fully satisfied by the connection they have with Capricorn."
