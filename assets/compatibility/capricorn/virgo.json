  "compatibility": "Capricorn and Virgo possess the same characteristics. These two signs make a sensible, prudent, serious and methodical duo. Virgo is a perfectionist, and at times seeks perfection through analyzing each and everything. This approach appeals to you Capricorn, due to your serious nature and the attention you pay to your status and accomplishments. The two of you may lack laughter and some fun when together, since it is difficult for you to express yourselves in a cheerful manner. Both of you can be caught-up or obsessed with work. Both of you like to set your mind on a goal, and you don't give up unless you achieve it. You may get stuck from time to time, when dealing with certain issues, but this does not hold you back from working toward your goals. Virgo often gets stressed when things are not perfect, and you strive to reach the top regarding the advancement of your career. The perfectionist tendencies that both of you exhibit may result in depression or stress, since things might not always go as planned. This is because your view on issues will be affected greatly by feelings of non-accomplishment and some kind of individual deficiency. Despite this, Virgo is able to objectively analyze and think things through better than Capricorn. This will often lead to Capricorn ending up stuck in a rut, and Virgo helping Capricorn to get through."
