  "compatibility": "This is a combination of air and fire which usually results in hot (sometimes VERY hot) air. Gemini is definitely inclined to stimulate Aries on many levels, and your interaction is quite explosive, with your air element fanning the fiery flames of Aries. The combination of these elements is usually an indication of exhilarating excitement. On physical and intellectual level, Aries and Gemini enjoy an unequaled friendship. You can spend hours having exceptionally great conversations, as well as many inspiring moments together. Aries considers the fast lifestyle and quick wit of Gemini a favorable fit that works well with their impatience and liveliness. Aries is incapable of being patient and this consequently results in both parties doing things at fast pace. Being impatient and always on the go, Aries realizes that not everybody is cut out for that kind of lifestyle. Aries has a great respect for those who have the capacity of keeping up with them. You should be ready for a crazy whirl of wild times and late nights, while with Aries. Being with Aries you are likely to experience great sexual and romantic connection. You are quite inventive and innovative in sex life, and you will desire to share experiences that Aries has not had in the past. You will keep inventing new tricks to turn them on."
