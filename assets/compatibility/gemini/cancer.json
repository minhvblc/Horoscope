  "compatibility": "Being an emotional and sensitive sign, Cancer's mood changes regularly, and this tends to bother you, Gemini. You are more thoughtful and you usually rely more on your intellectual, than emotional side. You tend to think and make decisions following your head, rather than your heart. Gemini is required to know the wherefore's and why's, since Cancer is incapable of understanding why others do not share similar feelings they have. An obvious gap exists between the nature of Gemini and Cancer, and it must be filled before the relationship can go anywhere. Although it might simply be an issue of accepting the existing differences between you. In order for Gemini and Cancer to have a stable relationship, it might be imperative for each to take on tasks, that you are good at. While Cancer handles well everything that involves feelings, Gemini is more proficient in issues that entail reasoning. If you can acknowledge this and implement the right sharing of responsibilities, your relationship will have much better chances of thriving. It may be difficult for you to train your mind to relate to Cancer's irrationality. Cancer desires Gemini to feel and connect with them, but since this may prove to be rather complex, Cancer prefers thinking and talking their thoughts out in the privacy of the bedroom."
