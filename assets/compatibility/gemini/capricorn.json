  "compatibility": "While there definitely might be a successful combination of Gemini and Capricorn, Gemini who is airy and has light energy, will immediately appear to be dragged down to earth by Capricorn. Gemini probably will not find this very appropriate and especially enjoyable. This sign combination usually has a great potential to work out well on a professional and business level, but not so often in a romantic setup. Capricorn has a very tight and powerful karmic connection with money. When paired, the two of you should talk intensively about materialistic mundane things. You should discuss what it is that both of you expect from your relationship with regard to financial goals and values. Managing your finances are likely to develop into major issues, unless they are sorted out in the very beginning. Although you might be careless regarding financial security and proceed to spend generously and freely, Capricorn has a likelihood of counting the pennies and being more frugal. This could easily be something that will drag you into a meaningless, yet very frequent and thus extremely exhausting fights over the control and management of money resources. It is rather difficult for both of you to remember what bonds you together in an intimate relationship, due to your opposite approaches to the world. If you operate on the basis of mutual respect and love, you will have the ability to overcome most obstacles, although both of you will be required to work very hard."
