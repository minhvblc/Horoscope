Your signs belong to elements, whose combination works considerably well together. Air is warmed by fire, and it in turn fans flames of passion. Majority of fire and air combinations have a successful relationship, and the Leo-Gemini match is no exception to that rule. Gemini and Leo can have a great friendship. Although most of the time their connection is not meant to be taken any further, they can still share many wonderful and joyful moments. Gemini easily satisfies the intellectual side of Leo. You will also appeal to Leo's social needs, as well as their emotional requirements. While Leo usually tends to dominate in a relationship, Gemini will not give up easily when it comes to the matter of seeking attention, and thus you will be engaged in a never ending game of \"who's got the power\". Mutual respect is required as both of you crave to be on the central stage of life. You will complement and satisfy one another on different levels. This will be perfectly expressed socially, as both of you are quite outgoing and love mingling with other people. Leo is also known for their enthusiasm and warm fire, which definitely stimulates you and makes you feel much appreciated for all your talents. You can also learn valuable lessons, both short and long term, from the creativity of Leo."
