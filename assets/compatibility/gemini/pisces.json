  "compatibility": "In regard to overall compatibility, the combination of Pisces and Gemini poses a challenge, due to the different elements that they represent (water and air respectively). Pisces's approach to life is considerably more instinctive and intuitive compared to Gemini's. The gut feeling of Pisces comes in handy when making decisions, while Gemini requires tangible proof, prior to accepting things, and may fail to see any logic in the manner that Pisces apply while making their decisions. Both Gemini and Pisces change their views often and rather easily. Both of you are similarly looking for excitement and variety in life. Gemini is however, motivated by an assortment of things. Each day that you are together becomes an adventure. Those adventures however, will have their ups and downs. Gemini and Pisces perceive love from the opposite angles. Gemini has a preference of using the mind when dealing with others, but Pisces is comfortable with social banter. Besides enjoying the company of other people, Pisces has a tendency of communicating on subtler levels and being more receptive. In order for Gemini to have a tight bond with Pisces, you have to learn to display an understanding and appreciation of the deeper aspects of life."
