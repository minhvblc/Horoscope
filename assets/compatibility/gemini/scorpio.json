  "compatibility": "The union of Gemini -- air sign and Scorpio -- water is likely to form rain, or more precisely -- a shower, and sometimes storm with lightnings. Gemini, you should prepare yourself for the intensity of Scorpio in every aspect of life. While you are intellectual in a frivolous, lighthearted way, Scorpio enjoys a radical and deep transformation. Scorpio is not impressed by idle conversation, but rather has the tendency of searching for the deeper meaning of everything, unlike you Gemini, who simply skims through topics. The planets that rule Scorpio and Gemini are Pluto and Mercury with Mars controlling the intensity of Scorpio. The complexity involved in reconciling these planets' attributes to the tendency of Scorpio to quite often grill Gemini, which could make you feel uneasy. However, if you are prepared to be probed by the relentless Scorpio, you might discover some things that were completely eluding you. You could attempt coaxing Scorpio to abandon their inflexible, tough approach and adopt a more easy going and brighter attitude to specific situations as well as to life in general. The upbeat nature of Gemini is however, likely to start exasperating Scorpio if applied too intensively. The bottom-line behind this sign combination is that it generally lacks adequate strength to keep the intimate relationship going. Although this combination faces major difficulties emotionally, one interesting thing is that it comprises a favorable arrangement for financial and business success."
