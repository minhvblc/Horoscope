  "compatibility": "Certain intrinsic differences exist between Virgo and Gemini, especially when it comes to their temperaments. For instance, Virgo has a detailed eye and a perfectionist attitude, which will drive Gemini crazy. You are likely to take pleasure playing intellectual games together, but Gemini has a preference of skimming on the surfaces of topics, rather than submerging themselves in the details, which is generally what Virgo prefers and is especially good at. Virgo possesses a reference to the family and domestic sphere of Gemini, and they offer a secure heaven to allow Gemini gain entry into their varied activities and ever-changing world. You will feel safe with Virgo, who will offer financial security and stability. It is one thing Gemini signs commonly lack in their lives. The inclination of Gemini to be jocular and lighthearted about life will often cause Virgo to be apprehensive and take things negatively. While Gemini may seemingly assume that certain jokes are harmless to Virgo, it is appropriate to remember that these may be offensive to your sensible partner. Virgo should however, learn to take things more lightly to ensure that their journey as they go through life is more fun. With regard to the romantic relationship, the survival of the union is dependent on your ability to learn and understand the approach, each has taken to love and life."
