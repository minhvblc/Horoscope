  "compatibility": "Aquarius is the seventh sign in astrology positioning, and is the opposite sign to Leo. Opposite signs in astrology are not what most people will perceive as either \"the opposites attract\" or signs that \"have nothing in common\". In Astrology the \"opposite signs\" are more like the two different sides of the coin. They are quite similar and are concerned with the same things. It's just they are oriented toward that same thing from the opposite directions. This is a suitable combination promising lasting partnership, although under specific conditions. Most chances are that the relationship will either succeed or fail drastically. Aquarius's intellectual inquisitiveness may attract Leo, who is always in search of attention. Aquarius, as a partner is calm, distant and unapproachable, while Leo makes an impulsive, at times very emotional partner. Matching Leo and Aquarius may not be ideal, but should work most of the times. Whereas Leo cannot stand Aquarius's distant nature, likewise Aquarius cannot put up with the attention seeking character of Leo. Under odd circumstances, both of you are similar in being self-centered and determined. You often fight over mundane issues, that are social or philosophical in nature. Both of you have to adjust, in order to have a meaningful relationship, instead of the union turning into a battleground. Surprisingly, in rare cases Leo can be conservative. It all depends on the birth date. This is contradictory with Aquarius's lack of consideration for conventional life issues. Leo fails to get the respect and mutual aid, needed in a relationship. At the same time, Aquarius detest the leading and commanding nature of Leo. Short time progress in work settings however, can be highly successful, where Aquarius is the intellectual mind, and Leo is more of a ruler. In this case this pair can form a powerful professional tandem."
