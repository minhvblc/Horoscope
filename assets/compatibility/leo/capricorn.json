  "compatibility": "An opposing force of your ruling elements will always keep the two of you apart. Capricorn belongs to earth and Leo represents fire, forming a deadly combination of lava. Putting these two elements together is likely to cause destruction. Capricorn is more pragmatic and down to earth, while Leo is full of fire, warmth and is embracing any communication possibilities with eagerness. Leo makes Capricorn feel uneasy with their fiery temperament and constant solar vibrations. Leo tries to assist Capricorn to solve complex situations that befall them. You may also find it really hard to change the serious nature of Capricorn. Leo is very spontaneous, which makes it hard for a much more organized Capricorn to grasp. The frugal Capricorn will not understand your largeness, which you as a Leo possess naturally. You want everything to be at its best, and you expect things to come in generous quantities, or else -- what's the point. Another distinguishing factor in this union is the ability of Leo to forgive easily, while Capricorn takes time before forgiving their Leo partner. Though love and friendship connections will not work well in this combination, business wise though, Leo and Capricorn can make excellent partners. If you are already in a good relationship with Capricorn, there is something that will hold this romance through all the hardships, and that is the loyalty of both of you. You both take your relationship very seriously and are very loyal to one another. And this strong trait in your tandem will out weight any minor insignificances that plague any relationship from time to time."
