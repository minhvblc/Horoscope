  "compatibility": "Mercury planet rules Gemini, making them very communicative and intellectual. This is the perfect match for Leo, who is a very proud sign. Leo normally seeks friendship from Gemini in order to cover up their inability to socialize without being arrogant because of their pride. Gemini will surely entertain Leo socially and can handle and satisfy their emotional side. Overall the two of you perfectly complement each other. Gemini loves with their mind, whereas the love of Leo emanates from the heart. Gemini is stable, romantic and can adjust to mood changes. Leo is very aggressive, so they need Gemini to tame this trait down. Gemini's habit of flirting with other signs is a kind of mockery to Leo. Since both signs are known for their ability to turn heads, this will not bother you too much, since you could always get your little sweet revenge by flirting with others as well. Both Leo and Gemini can have fun together, and since they are not so uptight they pay less attention to minor problems. They both yearn for a zealous and emotional lifestyle, though Gemini prefers to keep their intimate desires a mystery. Leo loves whole-heartedly, without holding any emotions back. Both of you are destined to be excellent business partners as well, since you suite very well intellectually and on the interpersonal level. Leo offers a source of inspiration, since they represent the fire. Gemini is the air and mentor in the partnership. The ever changing and airy Gemini can often frustrate Leo. And since you, Leo, are not the most patient type, you will be struggling to understand the unsettledness of your Gemini partner."
