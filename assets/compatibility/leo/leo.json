  "compatibility": "It is tricky to deal with your own match. Whereas at times you may feel like being in charge, it is hard to convince a fellow Leo to abide to your rules. Joining two Leos may either form a dual sign which is so powerful, that it will be capable of brightening up any relationship between the two, or, on the other hand, it may lead to a total disaster. It can turn into a complete failure, if both of you hold on to your egos. Forget about expecting something in return, if involved with a fellow Leo, hence it requires compromise to make this relationship work. The main problem with a Leo-Leo relationship is their concern about public image. You both need to be right in the spotlight of everyone's attention. So you will find yourself fighting for it all the time, since no one will be willing to take the back seat. In addition, both of you try hard to avoid showing emotions, because you believe that it will portray weakness. The connection can succeed if it is based on honesty and loyalty. You should avoid competing with each other. The Leo-Leo emotional aspect is compatible, since both of you care deeply about the ones you love. Leos are very passionate and romantic in intimate relationships. While some of Leos can be quiet, most Leos are outgoing and larger than life, so imagine all the fun you could be having together, doing this crazy thing you didn't plan on doing just 10 minutes ago. For business purposes, Leo-Leo creates a strong, reliable and loyal partnership. However, no relationship can exist without fights. The romance will only work if you learn to compromise and share."
