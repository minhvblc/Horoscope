  "compatibility": "Combination of the fire of Leo and air of Libra will lead to a warm atmosphere, which is perfect for everlasting companionship. Libras are usually very loving and trying to please. They are open-minded, optimistic and view life from angles, which are different from Leo's. This will give you many interesting insights. Libra fits well with almost any sign. Libra is often referred to as chameleon, because of their adaptability and dislike for conflicts. In a relationship, Libra will be very articulate and well balanced. Although Leo is usually honest, they cannot match the honesty and keenness that Libra portrays, hence Leo has to be meticulous when dealing with a Libra partner. Evidently, there is a certainty that the relationship will work out for the best. You, as a couple, share charisma and vigor in this relationship. You are so noticeable, that you will attract attention at any public event. Both of you can satisfy each other's desires and intimate needs. The indecisive nature of Libra places Leo in charge in both social and work relations. In other aspects though, Libra gives more instructions and directions than Leo does. In most cases Libra's attitude frustrates Leo a great deal, as Leo is a powerful sign with a predisposition to dominate in relationships."
