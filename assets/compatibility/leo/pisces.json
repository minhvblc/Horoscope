  "compatibility": "To build a lasting relationship, the two signs have to be compatible in the first place. Mixing fire and water is not the best combination, and it will require scrupulous planning. In this relationship one partner should be able to withhold their ego and constantly compromise. This can not be you Leo, since it will be too hard for your public nature and show off personality. So, most likely, it will have to be Pisces, that will compromise on almost everything, but you still need to meet your partner halfway on something else. Leo and Pisces have a very different take on life, thus it becomes difficult for you to reconcile after a misunderstanding. In order for Leo-Pisces partnership to work out, you will have to share mutual respect and forbearance. However, on the positive side, Pisces are enthusiastic to show Leo how magnificent it is to have a partner to love and treasure. Leo, at the same time, provides much needed warmth and support for Pisces. You will share your confidence and help shy Pisces to gain high self-esteem and not to give up on their dreams. You will also gladly provide needed support in any way you can. Therefore, you cannot rule out a good relationship when these signs come together, but this relationship will require considerable amount of work in the long run."
