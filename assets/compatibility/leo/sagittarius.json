  "compatibility": "This is a very explosive combination, with both stars representing fire. Sagittarius's honest approach is similar to the forthrightness portrayed by Leo. Other signs find it hard to establish any form of relationship with Sagittarius except for Leo, who tries to understand every situation. Sagittarius knows how to attract Leo intimately, as Leo fancies their adventurous soul and also the love for traveling. There is instant attraction at first sight, with eagerness to enjoy life together. Hang around Sagittarius to explore the world and embark on a life-changing journey to discover the world. Other signs may find it intolerable to accommodate the cruel sincere tongue of Sagittarius. It tends to hurt Leo's emotions too, but since Leos usually are very confident with themselves, it is easy for them to overcome Sagittarius's sarcasm, and most of the times not even pay attention. What can further help Leo deal with Sagittarius, is to become hardheaded and grow thick skin, so they can absorb any potential insults from this flaming union. You find it easy to relate to the cruel sincerity of Sagittarius, since you are much like Sagittarius in this sense, only you are much more diplomatic. Leo is an honest sign, that cares what close people think about them and will mostly always tell the truth. Your romantic life should be very exciting, creative and invigorating and this can be the ingredient that solidifies the union."
