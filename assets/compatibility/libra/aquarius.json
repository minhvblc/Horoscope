  "compatibility": "You share the same air element, which means that you will be inevitably attracted to each other, and you will probably hit it off on your first encounter. Libra has a natural romantic connection with Aquarius and their crazy antics will only serve to draw them more to Libra. An Aquarius is very social and can cope well in both small and large gatherings. This is where you find common ground, since you are both very social. While Aquarius tends to be revolutionary, you are more diplomatic, but both of you have a desire to develop intellectually. This means that you will always have issues to discuss and debate, whether it is social or political, and no topic will be taboo. This gives you the opportunity to develop and also understand each other better. The only problem that you may have with Aquarius is their inability to commit. Aquarius usually has rather non traditional views on marriage and might push you to try their free love concept, which might be too much for your way more conservative nature. It will be hard to ground the airy nature of Aquarius, but once they decide to commit, the relationship will definitely last."
