  "compatibility": "Being a great conversationalist, skillful story teller, as well as a social activist, Libra will not have a problem drawing Gemini's attention as the relationship starts. The initial attraction between these two signs is sparked by the blending of their traits. Libra thinks on a general basis while Gemini is changeable, versatile and loves to shift from one topic to another. If Libra can attract the attention of Gemini and maintain it for a long time, the relationship is bound to succeed. Diplomacy of Libra will help to overcome some of the difficulties caused by the unstable Gemini. Libra is more of a monogamous individual with a high tendency of commitment when it comes to relationships, while Gemini is more of a spontaneous sign, who loves to take things one step at a time. This makes Gemini highly likely to become a heart breaker, if they do not control themselves. For the relationship to succeed, Libra should ignore the social nature of Gemini and the way they interact with different people, and accept it as a part of Gemini's nature. Gemini can teach Libra some great lessons, and Libra, in turn, can learn to be more self-sufficient and create a more independent and versatile identity for themselves. In order to co-exist without many problems, both of you will have to accept each other just the way you are."
