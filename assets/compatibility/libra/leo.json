  "compatibility": "Libra has a very sociable personality and is mostly surrounded by people, sharing their company and liveliness. Libra's view of life is extremely wide and this makes it easy for them to fit in with people from different places. Libra is also able to adapt to any environment that they may find themselves in. It is because of these qualities that Leo finds it difficult to resist Libra. A strong union is bound to grow from this pairing. For Libra, arguments and confrontations are out of the question, because Libra values diplomacy. Leo is different from Libra in this regard and is likely to get involved in a confrontation at the very slightest provocation. Most of the times your diplomacy will lead to a peaceful resolution quite easily. Leo is usually honest, but has a crude way of presenting issues, and this is likely to put Libra off. This romance has a potential to grow into an excellent long-lasting relationship. Libra has a charisma that will easily draw Leo in. Partnering with Leo either in business or on a romantic level is likely to produce positive results. The more you interact with each other, the more you discover the unique traits each of you have. Some of the things that you share in common include going out to dinners, hosting parties as well as other social functions."
