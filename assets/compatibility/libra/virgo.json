  "compatibility": "The social and outgoing nature of Libra will do a great job of balancing the choosy and unpredictable nature of Virgo. Libra's friendship is genuine and there is good interaction as a result of your open communication. This relationship can make Virgo more outgoing and lively. However, the shy Virgo has another side to them which is characterized by their constant criticism of others. This will not be much of a problem for you, since you generally like criticism, as you believe it will help you improve yourself, but everything has a limit and you will have to explicitly set the boundaries with your Virgo partner, as it may sometimes get out of hand with them. Since Libra follows the principles of justice, they will be able to assess issues from different angles without rushing to make a judgment. Taking time to listen to any opinion and weighing them appropriately may help to further the cause of Libra and Virgo. The usually easy going nature of Libra does not also tie in very well with Virgo, who likes paying attention to detail. There needs to be some adjustment made by both of you in order for things in this relationship to move along smoothly. At the beginning, you will need to establish your boundaries so that the two of you will be able to retain some freedom to explore your exciting social world and enjoy each other."
