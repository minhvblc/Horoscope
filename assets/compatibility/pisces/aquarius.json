  "compatibility": "Typical Aquarius is a day dreamer, dwelling million miles away. This is in fact what will attract you at first, but being emotional and needy, you, Pisces, will get tired of it very quickly. Both Pisces and Aquarius are caring people. They have their minds set on making a difference. Despite the fact that they both care, Pisces is more emotionally attached than Aquarius. Aquarius is then left with the sole responsibility of comforting Pisces, when things do not go as planned. These two signs have different lifestyles and crave quite different things. Typical Aquarius is stubborn and capricious. Being a fixed sign, they won't be willing to see the problem, much less to change. Consequently, unless you are willing to offer more in this relationship, it is unlikely to last. Also, Aquarius is a social person and at times may not fully understand your need for privacy. This however, does not pose a serious challenge between the two, as this issue is fairly simple to solve. When it comes to serious relationship, Pisces has to bear in mind the fact that Aquarius is more spontaneous, and thus Pisces should not take personally the changes that the union might experience. You are both very intellectual signs. You will enjoy spending time discussing metaphysical topics, due to your ability to undertake comprehensive research regarding certain matters."
