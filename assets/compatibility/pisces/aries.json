  "compatibility": "This combination seems very appealing, but not for long. The initial attraction is instant and strong, but a long term relationship will be exhausting for both of you, since it will be hard to find common grounds. Pisces is a kindhearted, gentle and considerate sign, which makes a sharp contrast with Aries, who is more of an independent and impulsive. In partnership, there is a high likelihood of Aries to hurt Pisces, due to the weak ability of Aries to get in touch with their emotional side. For the relationship to work, both of you have to compromise significantly. Aries must be compassionate and considerate to the feelings of Pisces, especially when they undergo disappointment and sorrow. Pisces will become stronger by learning from the rough experiences provided by Aries. Aries needs to learn to be more tolerant when Pisces becomes too timid, which aggravates Aries. Still, Pisces and Aries are not complete opposites. They have a compelling force when they come together. Pisces are soft, artistic, vague, creative and mostly like to keep everything to themselves. They like to fantasize and drift at times. On the other hand, Aries is fast, outgoing and needs to be on top of things. This combination gives a lot to learn from each other. It can improve both signs' characters, if you manage to stick together for long enough."
