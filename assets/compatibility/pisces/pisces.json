  "compatibility": "Two Pisces have a mutual connection that is silent and extremely psychic. They are both intuitive and have a general interest in expressing their dreams and fantasies. Both of you are introverts. You are gentle and at times you require to be alone to recharge your spirits. Both of you are the rare people that can sense and unwillingly absorb the energies of others around you, which can be stressful and inuring. Plus Pisces have a tendency to be sentimental because of everything and anything that surrounds them. Your relationship will open up an avenue for the intuitive link between the two of you. If one is down, the other will have a gut feeling that there is something wrong, without having the specifics. Two Pisces will find solace in one another and will be willing to compromise and forgive each other. This similarity has a down side to it as well. It might be difficult for either one to uplift the spirits of the other, when they are feeling down. Pisces are compassionate. Fairness has the utmost importance to them. It always seems as if the two of you got a raw deal and thus you must learn on how to make better decisions while facing certain situations. Neither of you likes making important decisions, neither of you is especially preoccupied with money, savings and other mundane things. You don't like being brought down to the earth by those materialistic issues. Since both of you are not materialistic, it can be a serious impediment to simple yet necessary things that need to be done on a daily basis."
