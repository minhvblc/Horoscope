  "compatibility": "Scorpio has a strong emotional depth and a vast comprehension of sentimental values. This makes them very compatible with Pisces, since you are a sympathetic and sentimental individual. Pisces and Scorpio are perfect mind readers and have a way of identifying feelings and thoughts of each other. They are also sensitive and intuitive and apply feelings to complex issues. If you believe in soul mates, a suitable Scorpio partner is the closest thing you'll ever find. Pisces is always accurate when they base decisions on first impressions rather than on after thoughts, so if there is a Scorpio that seems right for you -- go for it, this relationship is very unlikely to fail. Scorpio can offer much needed protection to Pisces. Pisces is vulnerable to manipulation. It is quite easy for others to take advantage of their kind heart. Pisces should also be very aware of subtleties in their Scorpio partner. Scorpio's protection may suddenly turn into control. At the same time, Pisces may resort to escapism in order to avoid some of the harsh realities of life, when they feel overwhelmed with issues. Since Scorpio is more independent than Pisces, they are always there to offer a shoulder to lean on. Both of these signs usually have a wide range of interests: music, dancing, artistic pursuits, fishing, swimming or boating and many other similar activities. In the bedroom it is an excellent match as well, since Scorpio loves the way Pisces treat the love making as an almost sacred act. Even though it might be tempting to give in to the sensuality of Scorpio, if you are not serious about the relationship, it is best to avoid it or defer until you have a better idea about where the romance is headed. Once Scorpio made love to someone, he expects faithfulness and claims ownership of that person, which may obviously lead to some problems, if you don't plan to get seriously involved."
