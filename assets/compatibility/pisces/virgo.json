  "compatibility": "Despite the differences that the two of you have, you are a perfect example of the saying \"opposites attract\". An astrological comparison of these two signs clearly indicates that you both possess absolutely opposite characteristics. Despite the differences, both of you can learn how to ameliorate each other's shortcomings. In this union Pisces is usually the one who has to make all the sacrifices for the sake of the relationship. At times Virgo may cause strain in the relationship by fussing over small details. If Virgo understands that you are above those little things and don't even notice most of them, it should not be a problem. Due to the timid nature of Pisces, Virgo must be careful when dealing with their partner, especially through minimal use of abrasive speeches. Virgo is more of a realistic thinker, while Pisces likes to get emotions attached to decisions they make. These different approaches make you compatible when it comes to problem solving, since you are able to make a balanced judgment. Both of you enjoy taking some time in solitude to reflect on life and other issues that you might be facing; this rejuvenates you both. But what's more important, it gives you, Pisces a chance to recharge your spirits. This time might be complemented with activities such as swimming, painting, listening to soft music and dancing."
