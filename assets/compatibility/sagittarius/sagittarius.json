  "compatibility": "When the two of you get involved romantically, it can be a hit and miss situation in terms of an intimate relationship. A combination of two Sagittarians can be a very powerful union that requires careful management. Joining forces with another Sagittarius will mean that both of you should promise to commit to your relationship. However, you will both fear to lose your freedom. The two of you share interest in adventure, sports, travel, philosophy and anything that can keep you physically and intellectually active. Try to avoid too much movement, because this will leave little room for a firm foundation, if both of you want to be in a serious relationship. Sometimes, you will be forced to put an end to your independent nature and commit to a relationship. Furthermore, both of you are honest in expressing yourselves, so you will be open with each other. Your social life will be very fun; this is an exciting match in terms of making friends, dining, wining and entertainment. Sagittarians are very competitive in nature, this means that you may end up competing against each other mostly in social situations. Be careful not to outdo each other if you want the relationship to flourish."
