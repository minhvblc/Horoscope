  "compatibility": "The two of you have very different qualities. Taurus is mostly concerned with material things that they can feel and touch. On the other hand, Sagittarians go for independence, spontaneity and freedom. Besides, you may never be able to give Taurus the comfort and assurance that they really need. Taurus has to feel that the financial and practical sides of life are satisfying. You always appreciate life the way it is and you handle issues with an ease. Moreover, socially you act hasty, and this could really irritate the delicate nerves of Taurus. Sagittarius's life is not programmed and structured like that of Taurus, and this difference may eventually make you feel like your partner is inflexible. This can frustrate you a great deal. One of the finer points that Sagittarians possess is the ability to change their mind and adapt to various circumstances. This may confuse Taurus, especially when they see how easily you adapt to different situations. Therefore, it will require both of you to make some adjustments if you really want to have a fruitful relationship. If you get rid of Sagittarian bravado, you will be able to discover your sympathetic side. It is your sympathetic side that will unite you with Taurus. You will need to persevere and be patient in order for the relationship to work."
