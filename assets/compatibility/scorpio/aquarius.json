  "compatibility": "Many people doubt whether a relationship between Scorpio and Aquarius can really work. This is because just like Scorpio, Aquarius is also very stubborn and craves power and control. Therefore, the biggest problem that this relationship will have to face is an unwillingness to compromise. One thing that sets you apart is that while Aquarius is sensitive, they are not afraid to show it. You, on the other hand, believe that expressing your emotions is a sign of weakness. Aquarius easily notices that and tries to provide an emotional fulfillment you need, even when you don't directly ask for it. Aquarians also like to face challenges head on, and if your relationship is on the rocks, they would rather try to work it out, than passively wait to see what happens. This means that if both of you choose to accept your differences, your relationship is very likely to last. Facing your troubles head on will also enable you to learn more about each other. To make your sexual life more interesting, you will need to learn how to communicate effectively with each other to unleash your passionate sides. You will also have to teach your Aquarius partner that actions speak louder than words."
