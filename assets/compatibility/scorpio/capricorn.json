  "compatibility": "Good friends at first, and then lovers -- this is how it usually works for Scorpio and Capricorn. When entering a new relationship, you will have to overcome your natural mistrust and learn to believe in one another. Once you get to know each other you will be extremely comfortable with one another as you have no inhibitions when talking to your Capricorn partner. You have a lot in common: you are conservative and unless you both agree on going out, Capricorn will just be as comfortable back at home. Your possessive nature can take a back seat when you are in a relationship with Capricorn because they expect too much from you. In turn, Capricorn will never give you a reason to doubt them. Capricorn is known to be hardworking, industrious, prudent and determined. Therefore, if you have any goals to achieve as a couple, Capricorn will be very cooperative. The traits you both exhibit also mean that your relationship will not be bridled by financial difficulties. However, you should be on the lookout because Capricorn is highly motivated by money."
