  "compatibility": "The relationship between Scorpio and Leo is expected to be very lustful. When Leo's element fire combines with Scorpio's element water, it creates steam. The two of you will have much to deal with, because you are both strong-willed and like having power and control. There is no way you could grab this blanket back from under a sleeping Leo, who is wrapped in it completely, leaving you with none. Don't rush into accusations though, as the next night you will be switching roles. If this relationship is to work, the two of you should learn to compromise and respect each other's opinions. A typical Scorpio and Leo combination can become the ultimate power couple. But only if you are both loyal and determent. The sex life is great, as you are completely in tune with one another. Scorpio is emotional, sensual and intense. Leo is dominant and flamboyant. The yearning for power and control is what attracts Leo to Scorpio. Though you might have much to work on, your relationship will be full of romance and immeasurable loyalty. There are things about Scorpio that might unnerve Leo, but this calls for some time to find the best way to deal with the issue at hand."
