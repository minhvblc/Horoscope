  "compatibility": "The relationship between Scorpio and Libra is bound to be one of the most passionate relationships Scorpio has ever had. Libra is attracted to the strong willed Scorpio, whereas Scorpio will be impressed by the sensuality of Libra. However, the controlling nature of Scorpio is sure to bring problems just like it does, when matched with partners from other zodiac signs. Libra is free spirited and would not like anyone telling them what they can and cannot do. The demanding and possessive nature of Scorpio is not going to sit well with airy Libra. Scorpio, you will really need to try and change your domineering attitude, if you want to be really serious about this relationship. Libra will not appreciate it when you force them to do what they don't want to, and prevent them from doing something they like. What can make this relationship more successful is compromise and willingness to bring new things and ideas into it. Your communication channels are wide open. You understand and articulate with each other at a level that cannot be experienced when matched with a partner from another zodiac sign. You should learn to trust your Libra partner, because though they seem not to be taking things seriously, they mean no harm, but instead care for you deeply."
