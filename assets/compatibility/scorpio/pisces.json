  "compatibility": "The relationship between Scorpio and Pisces is almost magical. It is full of amazing love and passion for each other. Pisces will accept you as you are and work with your flaws for the greater benefit of the relationship. Pisces will understand and touch you in a way, that no one else has before. Their ability to accept you just the way you are will definitely make you fall in love with Pisces. On the other hand, your practical approach to life and your no-nonsense attitude is what Pisces requires in a mate to make sure that Pisces's wild imagination does not get the best of them. Pisces tends to be overly emotional, and you will therefore need to carefully watch what you say. Scorpio will help Pisces to see things practically, rather than emotionally, in order to avoid some of the unnecessary heartache that seems to hunt Pisces. The compassionate nature of Pisces will counter the demanding and controlling nature of Scorpio and lead to an understanding between the two of you. The kind of love that Scorpio and Pisces have is the undying kind and no matter what happens, you will still hold on to each other."
