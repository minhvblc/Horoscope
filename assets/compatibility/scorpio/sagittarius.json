  "compatibility": "One common factor between Scorpio and Sagittarius is that both of you are goal oriented overachievers. While Sagittarius is always ready to try out new things and see new places, Scorpio only wishes to concentrate on home and love life. At the same time, Sagittarius compliments your conservative and quiet side by being outgoing and surprisingly bold. At first, this trait might not sit well with you, but you should keep in mind that Sagittarius is also thoughtful and would not do anything without thinking over all the details. Sagittarius may get you out of your comfort zone and teach you to let go and have fun. Your relationship with Sagittarius is also set to get some tongues wagging due to the unexplainable chemistry between you two. As usual, your controlling and possessive nature can lead to the end of an otherwise beautiful relationship. Your inability to trust your partner because of their outgoing and friendly nature may end up making Sagittarius insecure. If you ever break up, you are very likely to remain good friends."
