  "compatibility": "It is said that opposites attract. This seems to be the case when Scorpio and Taurus get together. Taurus is known to have a certain kind of appeal that Scorpio finds very hard to resist. Taurus does not necessarily speak much but their presence is very hard to ignore. Taurus's silence speaks volumes. Taurus is also known to be stubborn and steadfast when they want things done certain way. This is bound to result in conflicts because you Scorpio, are also known to be very strong willed. The two of you need to learn not only to compromise, but also to respect the views of the other partner. While Scorpio is generally a very sexual sign, Taurus is more emotional and sensitive, and would need more than sex from you, to show them that the relationship can indeed last. Taurus will help you get in touch with your softer side, while you will give Taurus confidence in their sexuality. Some of the things that would threaten to break a union between the two of you include money and power. Scorpio, staying true to your nature, you will try to take control, which will not sit well with Taurus."
