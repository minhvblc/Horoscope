  "compatibility": "The two of you make a very good combination, because both of you are affectionate, passionate and very loving, and you are not afraid to show it. Your desire for security and a feeling of stability makes you ideal for each other. While Cancer is very imaginative, Taurus understands it, especially when it comes to mood changes. You know how to solve problems. The good thing about this connection is that your differences work for you, and not against you. While Taurus is attentive, Cancer is more responsive. With some time and work, there will be progression in your relationship. Although the two of you have different personalities, the strength of one supports the weakness of the other. This is most probably a satisfying relationship, and there is a chance of a successful marriage sufficing, if the two of you are both willing to give more than you receive. The two of you have a lot to share such as assets, faults, deficits and the same attributes. A union of the two of you spells out the word responsibility. Cancer is ideal for sharing ideas and interests, security and permanence. Both of you have a sense of maturity making your relationship a success."
