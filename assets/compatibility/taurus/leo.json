  "compatibility": "Taurus will have to abandon stubbornness and let Leo take the leading role in the relationship. While Taurus is egoistic and reserved, Leo remains sympathetic and active. Although Taurus tries to be affectionate and loving, Leo is hard to please. This with no doubt will bring some complications to the relationship. Taurus wants their feelings returned. Taurus finds it extremely difficult to worship and adore Leo. Leo is a spendthrift and this may not augur well with Taurus, because you are deliberate and cautious. The two of you may be compatible romantically, but it will be difficult for a relationship to stay afloat, if you do not put significant amount of effort into it. While the two of you have a strong emotional and physical attraction, you will be faced with many hurdles that might force you to give up eventually. This relationship sticks more toward being a romantic affair, rather than a solid partnership. Leo loves being in the spotlight, while Taurus prefers to stay in the background. Taurus has a lot to learn from Leo, if you are willing to embrace it. The two of you may be very collaborative when in agreement, but you will need to work on reaching that middle ground."
