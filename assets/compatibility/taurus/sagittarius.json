  "compatibility": "When these two signs come together the relationship may be very steamy. Taurus finds the passionate and pleasant nature of Sagittarius exciting, but that is just about everything the two share. The two of you have very different personalities. Taurus wants to control Sagittarius, while Sagittarius treasures personal freedom. Both of you have some domestic abilities and talents, but you do not seem to notice this and realize that those can actually bring you together. Taurus is romantic and appreciates the imagination Sagittarius has. The two of you are good lovers and are compatible to some extent, but your union has a short future and marriage does not have any favorable prospects. Taurus can build a future with Sagittarius only if they both review their objectives and make sure to accomplish what they start. Taurus finds Sagittarius to be quite a challenge, but it is this challenge that will unearth the potential of Taurus. The two of you have a way of attracting other people, this is a good thing, because it can land you on a good financial deal."
