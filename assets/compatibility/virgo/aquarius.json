  "compatibility": "Affiliations with Aquarius seem challenging to Virgo. Aquarius perplexes you and makes you yearn for more love and friendship from them. At first, the connection will not be mutual, but after getting to know Aquarius, the relationship will explode for the better. It is not likely for you to meet Aquarius through social events, as Aquarius is normally serious and only loosens up in work environment, with people they already know. This makes it ideal for Virgo to approach Aquarius at the office, and it usually happens when you are sharing responsibilities while working on the same project. Through such professional interactions, Aquarius will notice your intellectual abilities and thereafter slowly become attracted to you. The two of you love to volunteer in humanitarian projects with an aim of giving back to the society. However, there are some differences between you two. For instance, Virgo is mostly nervous and withdraws from expressing emotions, because they are naturally shy. Aquarius is more into Mother Nature and wants to have a positive influence on the world. They will convince you to engage more in social events, which you find to be a good gesture. To some extent, the two of you are somehow perfectionists in whatever you do, therefore Aquarius and Virgo connection glows. Trying to work together is suitable to strengthen and prevent unfavorable attitudes."
