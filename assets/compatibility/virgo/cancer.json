  "compatibility": "Susceptibility is a common characteristic for these two signs. The combination is perfect and has high possibilities of being successful, even in tough situations. Both signs are not too outgoing, they are rather stay-at-home kind of individuals. You would have a better chance to meet, if you are introduced by mutual friends. This relationship will have a long start, but it has a great potential to blossom over time. With Virgo being so reluctant to commit, it will be up to Cancer to send a positive impulse that will make Virgo interested. It will not take long however before Cancer receives a reply. Cancer makes great friends, has a good heart and is very compassionate. However, Cancer also tends to have regular mood swings and insists that their feelings would always come first. Virgo is usually patient, but can get irritated with Cancer who wants to be pampered all the time. Virgo has an intellectual way of dealing with problems, while Cancer takes minor disagreements personally. Emotionally, Cancer partners are not so strong; they lean on Virgo for comfort. This relationship is suitable, with Virgo knowing how to handle all emotions exhibited by Cancer, and not criticizing or making any overly judgmental comments."
