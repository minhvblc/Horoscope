  "compatibility": "Capricorn is known to be self-disciplined and has a quest for hard work. It is a good combination for Virgo, who is known to be orderly. Earth rules these two signs, which forms a solid foundation for a successful relationship. You both admire each other's high intellectual abilities. Both of you are also quite reserved individuals, who prefer to have a couple of close friends rather then many acquaintances. Both of you are sympathetic and polite. Capricorn can teach you to concentrate and focus on achieving your goal, while you can teach your Capricorn partner to appreciate and enjoy the hard work they have done. Capricorn and Virgo make a good couple, whereby you are able to bring out the fun living side of Capricorn. Both of you opt for cost-effective items and are very cautious when making financial decisions. Once in a blue moon, Virgo can oppose the opinions Capricorn offers, but in most cases, you are critical on what you say, avoiding any arguments. Surprisingly, Virgo totally trusts Capricorn, when in a relationship. Financial combination between the two of you is fantastic, because both of you know how to handle finances and budget very well. Any monetary issues you have, will get resolved quickly and efficiently."
