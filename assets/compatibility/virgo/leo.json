  "compatibility": "The combination of Virgo and Leo can be almost frightening. Being too egocentric, Leo needs to be the leader and driver in this relationship. At times, Leo partner can be very aggressive as they feel a constant need to protect their territories. This nature makes it difficult for Virgo to resist Leo, who, although may be too over-confident, has a special tender spot. The relationship also becomes sweltering after Leo adjusts to the soft and sensitive Virgo. You go for excellence in every endeavor you undertake, while Leo yearns for power and public approval, rather than excellence. Virgo mostly will not want to be the center of attention, while Leo wants domination. They crave to be the focal point of each and every person. Leo does not take negative criticism well, to them it feels like Virgo is stepping on their ego, and if you are not careful, it will cause serious commotion in the partnership. In the financial aspect, Virgo handles financial matters well while Leo with their not so caring attitude will cause Virgo to incur heavy losses. Intimately, Leo supplies the fire in a love relationship, while Virgo can be too conservative. Leo partners are in for a physical relationship, and this will not work great with you, Virgo, because of the formal approach that Virgo displays in an intimate union."
