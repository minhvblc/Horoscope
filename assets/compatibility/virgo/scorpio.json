  "compatibility": "Nature offers possibilities that make this relationship wonderful. Virgo represents earth and Scorpio represents water, both of which are very crucial elements for survival. This is one of the perfect compatible couples. Both Virgo and Scorpio complement each other, with both being dependent on each other to fulfill their desires. The connection is good between the two of you, but you can face difficulties at some point in life. The two planets ruling your signs are what can cause friction in your union. Pluto rules Scorpio determining their character, which is stubborn, leading, and provocative. On the other hand, Mercury influences the nature of Virgo which is silent, self-cautious, and logical in every aspect. If both are involved in a long term relationship, you will feel as if Scorpio does not show respect and cares less about your emotions and feelings. At times, Scorpio will dislike the fact that Virgo is often calm and likes paying too much attention on minor things. Scorpio easily gets irritated and angry with you when you start acting temperamental. Solutions to a good relationship include jointly solving personal differences. In addition, Scorpio should try to understand some of Virgo's traits. When the two of you get past these basic differences, you are likely to form a life long and stable union."
