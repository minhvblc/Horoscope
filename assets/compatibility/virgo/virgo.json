  "compatibility": "It is not an easy task to deal with the same zodiac sign as you are. Both of you know of each other's potential weaknesses and strong traits way too well. Another Virgo is almost like your mirror reflection. It can take some time to get used to watching yourself as if it was \"from an outsider's view point\". On the other hand, these similarities can work to your advantage, as you can become real partners in crime. Both of you may stipulate perfection from one another. Thereafter realizing perfection from both parties is not possible, you can settle for less and establish a long time acquaintance. Virgo normally bases their relationships on love, and believes this is the only way a relationship can succeed. Both of you are responsible, intelligent and prefer long-term partnership, rather than mere physical attraction. It is rare to irk each other in this combination, with each Virgo partner having too much passion to share. You will also encourage and support one another in career goals, educational advancements and mostly when one partner is going through emotional issues. The success of your mate will bring much pleasure to the relationship. Perseverance and bearing with each other's weaknesses, is what will make this relationship work."
